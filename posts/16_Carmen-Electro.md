Plant Bass’d Takeover 016: @carmenelectro

With one of the coolest names in the game for sure, Carmen Electro takes over our playlist for its 16th edition!

Carmen is a Finnish DJ and producer based in Berlin.

Having grown up on the dancefloors of London and Berlin, Carmen crafted her diverse taste from classic techno to rave, trance, bass music, and beyond.

After gaining exposure through shows on Berlin's infamous HÖR radio (and becoming somewhat of a regular), and with lineups and a contribution to a VA coming in later this year, she is excited to share her music with more fellow ravers in the very near future.

Providing everything stays on track Carmen will be playing in Dublin this coming September on an exciting bill hosted by @raveagainstthemachines which you can still snatch tickets for through their page.

Keep a close eye on Carmen’s Feisty Recordings project run along with @deankerosin, which showcases the darker side of electro and techno with mixes from some special talent from across Europe.

10 big techno, electro, trance and break hitters have been added to the playlist from Carmen as well as sharing with us an insight into the state of affairs with clubbing in Berlin right now and how it has began to open up (see graphic above).
