Plant Bassâ€™d Takeover 005: @roohoneychild

Roo Honeychild is a DJ, producer and party thrower based between Dublin and Glasgow and she is a founding member of arts and party collective @clubcomfort\_\_\_.

2019 was a busy year for Roo with performances across Ireland, the UK and Europe, at festivals like @alltogethernow.ie and @openearfest, as well as regular stops at @thesoundhousedublin.

Along with this came appearances on @nts_radio, @rinsestagram, @reprezentradio and @redlightradio, monthly @clubcomfort\_\_\_ parties and Comfort Carnival, an award winning small festival produced by the @clubcomfort\_\_\_ crew in partnership with the @dublinfringefest 2019.

Despite the pandemic, Roo has kept busy improving her production skills, and has at least one significant project awaiting announcement for spring 2021. Sheâ€™s determined to be first feet on the dancefloor once we can rave again.

Expect juke and footwork from these 10 picks. We canâ€™t wait to see Roo back in action!
