The brainchild of local spinners Digging the Underground, MARGINS initializes at Sneaky’s this Thursday, offering up a safe and inclusive space and lineup massing the 2 step side of dance music. Headliner Angel D’lite (Banoffee Pies Records) tops a three act bill set to span through garage, rave and breaks with Sosi (GRDN) and Melly (itsnotradio) ready to rattle on warmups. One of our picks for the week!
