For the first time since pre-pandemic, Edinburgh's Fringe Festival returns in its entirety with a complete programme after last year's stuttered return to action. It opens up a unique month for clubbing in the city as venue licences are extended to 5am for the duration of the festivities.

2022 sees a vast array of international talents and local club nights come together to puff their colours as Auld Reekie goes full carnival mode for the month of August with acts like DJ Assault, Jeff Mills, and DJ MELL G to name but a few all landing in the capital over the next few weeks. We have highlighted some of the nights we are hotly tipping to live long with clubbers in this Fringe Special Guide.
