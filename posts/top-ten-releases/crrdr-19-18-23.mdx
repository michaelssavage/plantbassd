>
  After a while without releasing, Putivuelta made a comeback with this release that, for me, is a
  must-listen. It's especially intriguing for the names that are there, the musical references, and
  what they have done to develop these sounds from Bogotá and Latin America.

>
  Muakk is one of the labels that is betting on fast and Latin rhythms from Latin America. They're working
  hard to visibilize the new sounds influenced by guaracha, tekno and juke. This compilation
  definitely marks the underground sound of this year.

>
  To me, it's important to consider the labels that matter in Latin America, specifically in the
  Andes and Ecuador. One label that stands out is Cumbia Tu Mente, and they just dropped a
  compilation this year that's worth checking out.

  This label is one of the pioneers in Latin club music, featuring great names in this
compilation that I always have in my USBs. It has my favorite artists and is also
an amalgam of sounds and atmospheres that fill the soul.

>
  Low Income Squad has been supporting these new sounds of Latincore for a while now and their
  compilation 'LI$036' shows us how, from the south of America to the old continent, these sounds
  have been exploring new and exciting directions that previously focused on ghetto, donk and
  hardcore.

  and experimental drums, for lovers of tribal music and hard drums. Volquete is one of the labels
  and parties that I'm sure will be talked about in the next few years.

>
  I stumbled upon this Underground Jewel directly from Brazil, and it showcases how Brazil has a lot
  to show because it has a lot of mega talented artists! With this release, I discovered a lot about
  their queer club electronic music and I absolutely loved it and highly recommend it. Super
  influenced by ghetto, electro, and funk, this album opened my eyes to a musical perspective in
  Brazil that I didn't know about until this year.

>
  If we talk about Latin club, we should definitely include Naafi, especially after this year's
  Pirata compilation. It includes many Latin American talents, clearly showcasing a lot of beautiful
  music and edits that are a must-play.

>
  Cuntry Club was one of the revelation labels of this year, especially in the realm of Latin music. They
  know how to curate their releases well, and surely they will be a label to talk about in the near future.

>
  'Rebote', Curated by Jaijiu and Nafftero, is also betting on drums, fast rhythms and hard percussions. This
  label for me has significant potential and I'm sure they will continue to grow due to the incredibly
  talented artists involved. This release has very good artists from the global south that add to its appeal and trajectory.
