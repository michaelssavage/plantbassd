  Aerga aka "the air or the ether" (as Gaeilge) comes in the form of a huge VA compilation featuring twenty one artists presenting avant-garde and genre bending electronic music.

As best described by the talented creaters of the label, Ethereal Skies, this release is a "A sonic journey that defies genre boundaries, contrasts the newskool with the old skool, and presents the dysfunctional possibilities of electronic music".
