## 1. Oldboy - RING RING EP

</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

One of the only releases I’ve picked that came out this side of 2022, however if I had to pick any, this takes the top spot. Hello Who This? from the EP could be my favourite tune of the year.

## 2. ATW (Interplanetary Criminal + Main Phase) - ATW002

<div class="col clubGuide">

Two heroes of mine and of the UKG scene!! I luckily got to support Main Phase a few months ago in Dublin and it was one of the first sets I had played in a long while without this EP (and his whole discography basically). 100% is one of the best to get a crowd really moving.

</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

While I loved the whole Peace LP, Kaboom! deserves a mention of its own. Roska is one of my favourite producers of the year, and this is one of the most fun tracks I’ve had in my rotation.

## 4. Sharda - Unreality EP

<div class="col clubGuide">
<img src="/top-ten-releases/hannah/4.jpg" alt="Unreality EP – Sharda" width="100%" />
</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

For the past few years Sharda has been one of my top producers. Sharda is just good for the soul - nothing quite encapsulates happiness for me as much as his releases do. Unreality came out earlier this year and It’s Alright is a reliable feel-good tune.

<div class="col clubGuide">
<img src="/top-ten-releases/hannah/5.jpg" alt="Chaal EP- Darama" width="100%" />
</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

Another release that’s featured heavily in my sets this year. Darama has a really cool sound and this is a great example, with Vera being my fav.

<img src="/top-ten-releases/hannah/6.jpg" alt="Baile do Soca Soca – Burna" width="100%" />
</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

I have been really enjoying Burna’s releases, I found him through this EP and it was love at first listen, especially Baile Pulse.

## 7. Rory Sweeney - Trash Catalogue, Pt 2

<div class="col clubGuide">
<img src="/top-ten-releases/hannah/7.jpg" alt="Trash Catalogue, Pt 2 – Rory Sweeney" width="100%" />
</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

Rory has been coming out with some of the coolest tracks and sets in the Irish scene at the moment, so it goes without saying that Trash Catalogue has sprung its way into my top 10 despite being a super recent release. The two parts have some class features like Veggies ft Curtisy, and my personal favourite off of Pt 2, Cheetah with E the Artist.

## 8. Prozak - dubs vol. 1

<div class="col clubGuide">
<img src="/top-ten-releases/hannah/8.jpg" alt="dubs vol. 1 – Prozak" width="100%" />
</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

Now this is an EP I’ve played to death, it’s hard to believe it even came out this year. I’m a huge Sugababes AND Black Eyed Peas fan so this worked out pretty perfectly for me. Prozak never misses!! Honourable mention to his Flowdan X Killas Army dub that came out recently with Over and Out.

</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

This came out early this year and while Curtisy has had a plethora of great releases since, this has consistently stayed in my rotation. Expecting to see all of these names even more next year!
