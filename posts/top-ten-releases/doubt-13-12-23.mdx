  title="1. Async Figure - It​’​s Pulling My Strings"
  pic="/top-ten-releases/doubt/1.jpg"
  bandcamp="album=2715948407"
  link="https://asyncfigure.bandcamp.com/album/it-s-pulling-my-strings"
>
  Second EP from Async advocates MM + Suda - proper forward thinking stuff, club fodder for the
  dystopic present and future. Real peak time drama with a bit of horror thrown in too. Lead single
  'Gen' is the ONE.

  title="2. DJ Polo & NKC - Lab Rat"
  pic="/top-ten-releases/doubt/2.jpg"
  bandcamp="album=2760562096"
  link="https://djpolouk.bandcamp.com/album/lab-rat"
>
  This one’s been on heavy rotation throughout my sets this year. Title track def the winner here
  imo, twisted remnants of UK Funky/Hard Drum and Baile Funk all thrown into a pot and deep fried -
  delicious.

  bandcamp="album=3543501532"
  link="https://ozwald.bandcamp.com/album/degrees-of-freedom"
>
  Large one from our own Ozwald that landed at the start of this year. Have heard at least one of
  these trax played on most nights I’ve been out in 2023. ‘Stone Cold Bangers’ was a phrase used by
  the Viper back in the day, I think that description is fitting here. More from the man in the New
  Year..

  pic="/top-ten-releases/doubt/4.jpg" 
  bandcamp="album=1072158133" 
  link="https://lurka.bandcamp.com/album/molten-drum"
>
  Lurka’s a true belter pusher churning out pure club material for the troops. Molten Drum does exactly what it says on the tin - charred and blown out percussion pushed to its hardest conclusion.

  title="5. Príncipe - DJs Di Guetto"
  pic="/top-ten-releases/doubt/5.jpg"
  bandcamp="album=3702852017"
  link="https://principediscos.bandcamp.com/album/djs-di-guetto"
>
  Big reboot of one the original Principe compilations feat. all your favourite Kudoro OG’s - 'É
  Africa' my fave off this one.

  bandcamp="album=3033792358"
  link="https://hakunakulala.bandcamp.com/track/ic3-menzi-remix"
>
Real menacing stuff here from Scratcha & Menzi. The MENZI remix of 'IC3' is a standout for me, great flip of Scratcha’s trademark tom line that you hear throughout a lot of his drum trax.

  pic="/top-ten-releases/doubt/7.jpg"
  bandcamp="track=2706171913"
  link="https://biancaoblivion.bandcamp.com/track/sinais"
>
  Dirty grime-y number with splashes of Baile Funk from Bianca Oblivion & ONHELL on this NAAFI
  single. Another one that’s done big rounds of the clubs this year!

  title="8. Giggs - Talking The Hardest (DJ Kwamzy Amapiano Remix)"
  pic="/top-ten-releases/doubt/8.jpg"
  bandcamp="track=2923852638"
  link="https://djkwamzyy.bandcamp.com/track/giggs-talking-the-hardest-dj-kwamzy-amapiano-remix"
>
  Could probably do a whole top 10 of just Ama bits from the last year but decided to narrow it down
  to this crazy edit from DJ Kwamzy. This kinda dark and moody strain of Amapiano that’s making
  inroads from South Africa to the UK is real exciting - special mention to D’athiz + Scratchas’
  DRMTRK imprint.

  bandcamp="album=1143323425"
  link="https://ossx.bandcamp.com/track/c240"
>
  OSSX consistently firing out the best Baltimore flips at an insane rate. Out of all the heat
  released this year 'C240' (from the AIR CONTROL EP) is the one for me. Real raw stuff, relentless
  drums layered over a massive Baltimore groove.

  link="https://soundcloud.com/jimlegacy/jim-legxacy-hit-it-light-it-twist-it"
>
  Not necessarily a club release but a big favourite of mine from this year. Bittersweet,
  melancholic, humorous + some genius sampling rolled into one. Can’t wait for the next release!
