  ‘U&Me (decemberseventeen)’, wow. The first time I heard this track I was mesmerised by the push
  and pull of the first half of the track and then you’re led to a beautiful resolve in the second
  half. Utterly beautiful. I am still yet to listen to the full album ‘Àlàáfíà’, which I’m excited
  to listen to.

  This EP is lit oh my days... If you’re looking to <b>shake nyash</b> it’s for you. BAMBII is
  really good at providing bangers in general, so I’m not surprised. My favourite track is ‘Hooked’
  ft. Aluna, it’s so sultry and sexy. Absolutely divine. It has been on repeat many a time.

  This song is for a soft twerk (or head bop) and because it easily loops (on repeat!!) you could
  find yourself doing that for a while sksksks. I love it.

  Oi, talk about an anthem. This hypes me UPPP!! I’ve been starting my days with this song, and it
  really gets me going. A 10.

>
  I’m all in favour of a pivot and New Blue Sun gives a graceful, super calming switch up. My mind
  usually runs at 1000 mph, so this has been feeling like a warm hug for the most part. I’m very
  happy and blessed to be in the same era and timeline as 3 stacks releasing an ambient album...

>
  I really like how every track is somewhat connected to each other. LCY’s production is so
  intricate and detailed which is duly appreciated. I think my favourite track is ‘Heartbreaker’;
  whenever I hear it, I always envision playing it in a club. Soon come.

>
  This is such a majestic piece of work. Every track flows effortlessly, I felt like I was on a
  journey. I’m so in love with it. The talent speaks for itself and all the featured artists on the
  album fit so well. The tracks that stuck were ‘The Graves at Charleroi’ ft. Coby Sey and ‘00 –
  Down / Murmansk, 12.’ Truly amazing!!!

>
  Honestly, a beautiful, enthralling and captivating track, as is most of Clarissa’s work. The
  violin accompanied with Clarissa’s main instrument, the Oud, provides a very compelling piece that
  has also been bringing me a sense of calm in some of my janky days.

>
  I started listening to Klein at the top of the year because I was looking to hear more black
  artists that produced ambient/classical music. Klein is amazing. I really, really enjoyed this
  album. I love the different tones and textures of sound that are encompassed within. It definitely
  felt like it was giving soundtracks to my life.

>
  I randomly came across this artist and basically decided to listen to a few of their songs.
  ‘Dreams’ is their latest release, which is a great song to sing along and dance to. It’s very
  upbeat and fun, it will put you in a good mood instantly.
