  title="1. Caroline Polachek – Desire, I Want to Turn Into"

  bandcamp="album=1842192137"
  link="https://carolinepolachek.bandcamp.com/album/desire-i-want-to-turn-into-you"
>
  Anyone that knows me, knows I absolutely LOVE a pop girlie. Caroline has cemented herself as one
  of the most exciting around. The entire album doesn’t have a bad track on it and showcases that
  Caroline can write a bloody song and sing!

>
  Windswept is one of my favourite jungle tracks in a long time. It’s that heavily filtered Oud (I
  think!) with the modern drum build up pattern just makes me lose my shit whenever it hits the
  break patterns. Both tracks feel so heavy embedded into 90s jungle while also taking modern takes
  from the new era of jungle and D&B. Obsessed!

>
  Burna is on fire. He has yet to release anything less than stellar. I’ve decided to put Ritmo Das
  Vielas as my favourite of this year because I love the early 2000s grime bass and pads paired with
  the bailie funk drum patterns.

  bandcamp="album=1982087819"
  link="https://tsvi.bandcamp.com/album/stella-remota"
>
  The story around this album is heartfelt and when you pair it with the minimal, atmospheric sound
  design it makes it an incredibly emotive electronic record. I play at least one song whenever I am
  asked to play heavier sets. My favourite track – the title track itself – with its intense and
  urgent atmosphere paired with a minimal drum design and operatic crescendo makes for unsettling
  and comforting listening all the same.

  bandcamp="album=3148662232"
  link="https://kindergartenrecords.bandcamp.com/album/packet-loss"
>
  The drums on Packet Loss is absolutely unreal. The chaotic textures in each track, yet carefully
  thought-out sound design has made this, in my opinion, one of the most underrated crossover
  records of the year. Airplane Mode is also the track that I feel like helped me bond with other
  DJs when stepping out of the booth lol.

  title="6. Darama – Chaal Pt. 2 "
  pic="/top-ten-releases/hu-sane/6.jpg"
  bandcamp="album=1440922359"
  link="https://darama.bandcamp.com/album/chaal-pt-2"
>
  A Continuation of Chaal Pt. 1, this feels much darker and stronger overall. It takes the heavy
  South Asian influences and magnifies them with heavier basslines. The entire EP sounds like it was
  born in a dark sweaty nightclub. Holloway Road feels like one of those true breakthrough tracks.

  title="7. KETTAMA – Fallen Angel EP"
  pic="/top-ten-releases/hu-sane/7.jpg"
  bandcamp="album=2715907238"
  link="https://steelcitydancediscs.bandcamp.com/album/fallen-angel-ep"
>
  I can’t say I feature a lot of Kettama’s music in my sets, but this EP is honestly stunning
  production wise. Fly Away XTC is completely euphoric in that build up. I always think about how
  this feels for the people that like to get on it in the nightclub and how it must feel like
  they’re on a different plane when this comes on!

  pic="/top-ten-releases/hu-sane/8.jpg"
  bandcamp="album=2937582706"
  link="https://sampha.bandcamp.com/album/lahai"
>
  Been waiting for Sampha’s second album for over 6 years and Lahai didn’t disappoint. I first heard
  this in my pals flat on vinyl while we applied for jobs in silence, and it felt like a core memory
  had been made. Light, hopeful and still absolutely well worth the wait.

  bandcamp="album=2694006994"
  link="https://0800shygirl.bandcamp.com/album/nymph-o"
>
  Shygirl has been a feature of my sets from my commercial nightclub days where I would freak people
  out with Uckers. Watching Shygirl’s journey to this deluxe release of the Nymph album has been
  fascinating. I think Nymph_o is better than the original with some collaborations and sound design
  that elevated everything to an even higher level than it was before.

  bandcamp="album=21941392"
  link="https://toumba.bandcamp.com/album/petals-ep"
>
  This EP has been a heavy feature in any warm-up sets I’ve been doing. Such a beautiful EP. So
  minimal and rhythmic at the same time. Favourite track is Hazzeh!

  title="11. Sevdaliza – Nothing Lasts Forever (with Grimes)"

  soundcloud="https://soundcloud.com/sevdaliza/nothing-lasts-forever"
  link="https://soundcloud.com/sevdaliza/nothing-lasts-forever"
>
  The only track on my list as I’ve always been a bit of an EP/Album person, but I couldn’t resist
  as this track absolutely goes off! I think this might be my favourite cohesive song of the year.
  Clearly inspired by the Dutch hardcore Sevdaliza grew up surrounded by. That bass/drum combination
  is epic with those hyper-pop autotune vocals. I’m absolutely in love!
