Plant Bass'd covered this 2 track release from LWS at the start of the year in our Fresh Juice series - <HoverLink url="www.plantbassd.com/fresh-juice/lws-1-3-22" external />. I love the trudging along sound that Lewis is able to conjure with the percussion and stuttering basslines. I'm certain 'Corrupt' is capable of taming snakes, for that it's my stand out of the two.

<div className="col clubGuide">

A compilation of six electronic tracks ranging from bass, breaks, and electronica. As well as Leon Vynehall's own contribution, there are five amazing artists to discover here, especially Derry native OR:LA and Femme Culture's Ehua. Top pick is 'Raw Cartoon.'

We don't know much about Protect Ryan other than they're composed of three veteran producers that “came together through their shared love of '90s rave culture” that don't really take themselves too seriously. The whole EP is primed for dark sweaty parties, but 'DJ Weddings and Receptions' stands out as the club-ready banger I need. The sample used adds to the goofyness (<HoverLink url="www.instagram.com/p/CbhpZdsgntg/" external />).

<div className="col clubGuide">

This has been Nikki Nair's year with solid release after solid release without any let up! The Atlanta rep has been molding his bass-heavy sound, taking inspiration from grime, footwork, jungle, and much more. 'Whaa' brings the energy with extra oomph from MC Logan vocals.

<div className="col clubGuide">

Balls-to-the-wall post-soviet electro and acid. Damn! Locked Club are doing big things. 'Dubai Girlfriend' is a terrifying bombardment of punk noise, it's my top pick.

## 6. Schacke - Apocalyptic Decadence

<div className="col clubGuide">
<Picture src="/top-ten-releases/michael/6.jpg" alt="Schacke - Apocalyptic Decadence" size={1200} />
</div>
<div className="col clubGuide">

This album “is essentially about the desire for hedonism and excess being amplified when faced with apocalyptic omens and the annihilation of the familiar.” Sex heavy themes portrayed by the sounds and artwork but I think it works perfectly as the soundtrack for first-person shooters like DOOM. An intoxicating dark techno ride (ha), 'Miasma Of Filth' is my no.1.

<Picture src="/top-ten-releases/michael/7.jpg" alt="Kornél Kovács - Hotel Koko" size={1200} />
</div>
<div className="col clubGuide">

Light and easy on the ears, Hotel Koko is a fun mix of floating house music. Big fan of 'Usch', a dreamy tune with luscious bells, delays, and flangers, and 'Get Goofy' which is a breakbeat remake of the pop track by MishCatt. My favourite listen on the album is 'Follow You' featuring Aluna with her comfy vocals and the rich Rhodes Keys.

</div>
<div className="col clubGuide">

DJ/producer An Avrin appears often on Scuffed Records (Love this label!) with his leftfield bass sound. 'Parroted' is snare heavy and my top pick. What's An Avrin spell backwards?

</div>
<div className="col clubGuide">

This compilation is a juke/ ghetto house / disco house release from October. The first and last tracks are some seriously groovy stuff that I've had on repeat since it came out. Can't get enough of the distorted, thumping kick and fun use of samples in Mainline 2022 and feel-good disco vibes in 'Fast Line'.

This goes FAST. Grab a pair of cans and hear Metrist pushing sounds around your headspace, panning left to right and front to back. While 'GMFGR' has me saying “How the F\*\*\* did he make that”, the sound designer and label owner's best track for me is 'Nathanielismo' with a ravey stabby synth that oddly reminded me of 'La Roux'.
