### A very Happy International Womenâ€™s Day to you all from the Plant Bassâ€™d Selektaz! And no better way to celebrate than to kick off the next batch of takeover guests with Wicklows finest, @trulymoore\_ .

An innovator spanning genres from jungle to drum â€˜nâ€™ bass to electro, Yours Truly is bringing back the ghosts of ravers past.

She has spread the sounds that have influenced her working with club events in @wigwamdublin, as well as recently appearing on @rinsefrance joining @shampain\_\_\_\_ on his resident show and @froman\_ for the Lighthouse Mix series.

Expect to see her name crop up on the club and festival circuit even more once the normality resumes.
Here are the 10 tunes Yours Truly is ready to play out once sheâ€™s back in the booth.
