### Jack Ward shares a cheeky, eclectic selection of tunes that have influenced and inspired his lockdown and recent productions.

Having recently came across Jacks's sound, it can be best described as a sound reminiscent of the upbeat house of @logic1000\_\_\_\_ and Lone.

The most recent single from Ward, 'My Angel Rocks 4th & Back' received plaudits from the people at @resident_advisor, @invertedaudio & @faceless_magazine\_. A bouncing house sound that will get you in the mood for summer festivals, or the beer gardens and garden parties that you may be limited to for the foreseeable weeks.

Recent remix duty on @daisies0daisies0daisies single 'Dido' further implements that sound and a guest mix for @darkpmavis Donuts show on @dublindigitalradio highlights the happy-go-lucky energy that Jack brings.

This week's tunes are fun and not to be taken too seriously, giving a similar warmth to the sound that Jack has become known for himself.

1. Baby Tate - Bob
2. Christine and the Queens - 5 dollars
3. Starship - We Built This City
4. Paul McCartney - Front Parlour
5. Alaska Reid - Oblivion
6. 21 Savage, Metro Boomin - Said N Done
7. Carl Stone - Au Jus
8. Buttechno - Poleva
