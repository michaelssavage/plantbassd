### @fpartyu and @visiondublin co-founder TOMÁS is our next feature on the playlist takeover.

A regular at @konspiracyclub and @fpartyu Tomás' hard hitting techno cuts are on the rise with recent releases on @milkitsounds and an upcoming release on @common\_\_\_\_ground.

With what last year should have had in store for this man, we hope that 2021 will be kinder. With sets at @lifefestival, @fuinneamh_festival, and support sets for @fjaak and @nancyliveuk under his belt, club time can't come quick enough.

Until then, here are 10 tunes that you could expect to hear in a @tomas.irl set: <HoverLink url="open.spotify.com/playlist/5skAgzUfGmZLwrOPNLnGVf" name="Plant Bass'd Picks." external inline />

@eggboy_design once again
