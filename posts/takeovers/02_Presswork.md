### Next up manning the Spotify is Dublin producer Tom McGrath.

He shares the 10 songs he’s ready to play come club time. He is a notable member of the exciting ring of young producers coming out of @dcudjsociety along with @pagan_909, @\_\_highfidelity, @\_\_fuam\_\_ , to name but a few.

Ranging from techno, electro and house, his sound has earned him releases on the likes of @zone_focus, @hate_collective, and @raveresidence, as well as a fresh release on the @chokibikirecords ‘Breaks for Days Vol. 1’ compilation.

Tom has donned the booth at the likes of @konspiracyclub, @wigwamdublin and @opiumlivedublin on the Dublin circuit and held a support slot playing with @mark_blair\_\_ in France.

At just 20, there is an exciting path being forged by Presswork and the sound he is crafting is without question club and festival ready. Kick your February off right.
