### This weeks takeover marks our first Edinburgh collab, and we are very pleased to kick start this branch with @mindt_hegap.

The club night that aims to showcase exclusively women, lgbtq+, and non-binary djs from Scotland and beyond. After kick starting in January 2020, in typical cruel covid fashion the surge of the club night was halted before it even really got started.

As a monthly series of @hectors_edinburgh, the opening nights saw performances from @steviecox\_, @hollieprofitdj, @djmintox as well a supporting takeover slot at the @mashhouse for @elliotadamson last Valentines night. This is a very ambitious and exciting series with a very topical and important focus and we can't wait to see the acts that will follow come club time.

Here are the 10 tracks the @mindt_hegap crew are patiently waiting to hear play out in the @thecabaretvoltaire basement: <HoverLink url="open.spotify.com/playlist/5skAgzUfGmZLwrOPNLnGVf" name="Plant Bass'd Picks." external inline />
