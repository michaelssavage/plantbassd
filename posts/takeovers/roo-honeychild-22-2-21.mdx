### Roo Honeychild is a DJ, producer and party thrower based between Dublin and Glasgow and she is a founding member of arts and party collective @clubcomfort\_\_\_.

2019 was a busy year for Roo with performances across Ireland, the UK and Europe, at festivals like @alltogethernow.ie and @openearfest, as well as regular stops at @thesoundhousedublin.

Along with this came appearances on @nts_radio, @rinsestagram, @reprezentradio and @redlightradio, monthly @clubcomfort\_\_\_ parties and Comfort Carnival, an award winning small festival produced by the @clubcomfort\_\_\_ crew in partnership with the @dublinfringefest 2019.

Despite the pandemic, Roo has kept busy improving her production skills, and has at least one significant project awaiting announcement for spring 2021. She's determined to be first feet on the dancefloor once we can rave again.
