### It is a year yesterday since we were set to stage Organized Noise 001, out the back of Seamie’s in sweet sweet Monaghan.

Unfortunately we are still awaiting to kickstart our party series in Monaghan and beyond but we are determined to bring these shows to you as soon as it is safe to do so.

For a special feature this week, the lineup for Organized Noise share the tunes they would be playing for you all were the gig to go ahead.

Picks from @fonzatronza (@sun.set.ships.music), @doubleduv\_ (@houz_music, @\_blutooth), and @soundslikebozo (@dublindigitalradio, @phevertv).

Some selekts shared from the plant Bass’d crew along the way too.

Rave ready sounds. We will be sharing selekts from the 3 guests as the week goes on.
First up is Fonzo!
