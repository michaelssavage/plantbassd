### Our good friend and fellow Monaghan native Luciid is first up sharing the 10 tunes he's patiently waiting to play out once the gigging renaissance commences.

The way 2020 panned out like for so many stuttered this mans momentum after a run of support gigs in @district_8_dublin and @monroesgalway opening for @rebukemusic and @t78official respectively pre covid. He's earned releases on the @dense_and_pika imprint @kneadedpains and dropped his 'Fugazi' EP on @autektone last August, and has another release with the former on the horizon.

It's a very exciting path for Monaghan's first real techno act and one of the country's most promising. He's had his numbers played out by the likes of Charlotte De Witte, Michael Bibi, Sara Landry and more. We're very excited to share his unique, raw industrial sound with you all.

1. Randomer - Sylo
2. MOTVS, ROBPM - Acid Metal
3. Thomas P. Heckmann - Himmel & Hoelle
4. Tobas Lueke - Elements (AnGy KoRe, Gabriel Padrevita Mad Mix)
5. Tim Tama - Designed 4DA Mind
6. Mark Michael - Labyrinth
7. OPFX - Inc√§d
8. Superstrobe - Noises
9. Linus Quick - Room 2 Move
10. Dense & Pika - Wisdom of Crowds

Also check out Luciid's own production, The Calling

Luke - "Like everyone else in the music industry, I can't wait to get back behind the decks again. While I've been busy with producing and upcoming releases on Autektone, I've also been listening to loads of fresh music. The ten tracks I have chosen will really appeal to anyone looking for that raw industrial sound to get them through the day."
