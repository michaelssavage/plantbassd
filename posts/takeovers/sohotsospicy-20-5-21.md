### @thrustcollective head girl Aoife Keane (sohotsospicy) is manning our playlist this week with four to the floor, big bass and electro!

Hard bass and footwork. That is the sohotsospicy sound. A sound that lies somewhere between the remnants of the bad attitude of @lsdxoxo and the Jersey club pump of @uniiqu3music.

Keane has just come off the back of a rough and ready collab with @darkpmavis on @common\_\_\_\_ground’s Talamh Records. The ‘sodarksospicy’ EP garnered high praise and boasted premieres on both @djmagofficial and @fourfourmagazine.

Keane has brought her club ready sound to the Dublin circuit in venues like @wigwamdublin, @buttonfactorydub, as well as playing @epfestival and @longitudefest with @gxrlcode.

These 10 picks give a glimpse, alongside her residency shows on @dublindigitalradio, of what we could expect to hear in a sohotsospicy set.
