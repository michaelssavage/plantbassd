### Our good friend and fellow Monaghan native Luciid is first up sharing the 10 tunes he’s patiently waiting to play out once the gigging renaissance commences.

The way 2020 panned out like for so many stuttered this mans momentum after a run of support gigs in @district_8_dublin and @monroesgalway opening for @rebukemusic and @t78official respectively pre covid. He’s earned releases on the @dense_and_pika imprint @kneadedpains and dropped his ‘Fugazi’ EP on @autektone last August, and has another release with the former on the horizon.

It’s a very exciting path for Monaghan’s first real techno act and one of the country’s most promising. He’s had his numbers played out by the likes of @charlottedewittemusic, @michael_bibi\_ , @saralandrydj and more. We’re very excited to share his unique, raw industrial sound with you all.
