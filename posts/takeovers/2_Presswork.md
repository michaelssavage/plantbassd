Plant Bass’d Takeover 002: @presswork

Next up manning the Spotify is Dublin producer Tom McGrath. He shares the 10 songs he’s ready to play come club time. He is a notable member of the exciting ring of young producers coming out of @dcudjsociety along with @pagan_909, @\_\_highfidelity, @\_\_fuam\_\_ , to name but a few.

Ranging from techno, electro and house, his sound has earned him releases on the likes of @zone_focus, @hate_collective, and @raveresidence, as well as a fresh release on the @chokibikirecords ‘Breaks for Days Vol. 1’ compilation.

Tom has donned the booth at the likes of @konspiracyclub, @wigwamdublin and @opiumlivedublin on the Dublin circuit and held a support slot playing with @mark_blair\_\_ in France.

At just 20, there is an exciting path being forged by Presswork and the sound he is crafting is without question club and festival ready. Kick your February off right.

Thanks again to @eggboy_design for the graphics. Check out his work.
