### Cork's very own Aoife O'Neill offers up this week's selekts as we reach week 8 of the Spotify Takeover.

Founder of the @outofspace808 party series which also holds down a residency on @dublindigitalradio, O'Neill has become well known for her electro and rave influenced sets.

She has been able to push this sound on the Irish festival circuit with appearances at @bodyandsoulirl, @epfestival (Anachronica/ Rave in the Woods), @alltogethernow.ie, @othervoiceslive, @openearfest, and was set to feature at last year's installment of @lifefestival .

International club dates in London's @picklefactorye2 and features on bills alongside names like @prosumerama, @orla_cd, and @s_p_e_c_i_a_l_r_e_q_u_e_s_t to name but a few have followed.

Most recently we seen Aoife showcase her talent on the @avafestival x @boilerroomtv takeover of @district_8_dublin just prior to pandemic times, and she has shared mixes on @nts_radio, @rinsefrance, @fourfourmagazine, and was due to appear on @hoer.berlin with @strawberriesdublin last October only for travel restrictions.

We are very happy to share 10 picks that Aoife is ready to play for her crowds when this is all over and we hope to be a part of her audience in the future!
