### We kick off our third batch of takeover guests with an ever promising act from home(Donegal/ Dublin), Pagan.

After bursting on to the Irish scene with club and dance tent anthems 'Mirage' and 'Comet on Sundays' in 2019, Pagan's (Rossa Doherty) stock has not been suppressed by pandemic times as much as others.

2020 saw Doherty's first release on a major label with 'Never Known' on the 'Peace, Love, Unity, Respect Vol. 4' compilation from @lobstertheremin. Once again with this release, we were reintroduced to the euphoric club sound that Pagan's productions have embraced in the last few years.

The turn of the year has seen Rossa already announce his debut EP, 'Wash Away Our Fears' on the @lobstertheremin sub-label '1Ã˜ PILLS MATE', with a further EP to be the inaugural release on @cheekymusicgroup's sub-label 'rrraaavvveee' (listen to the featured single here <HoverLink url="cheekymusicgroup.bandcamp.com/album/butterfly" external inline />).

Having already racked up sets at @yurt_city, @highervisionfestival, @lifefestival, as well as being a @konspiracyclub regular, we can expect to see the 2019 @avafestival Emerging Producer Winner continue to grow his influence beyond Irish shores.

With his sounds being complimented by the likes of @dj.boring, @justinjaymusic, and @alanfitzpatrick of late, Pagan is ready to return to the booth as soon as possible along with his growing catalogue to boot.

Here are 10 tunes that have influenced the Donegal native over the last 12 months, including his latest single 'Wash Away Our Fears'.
