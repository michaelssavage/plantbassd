### The duo behind Bahrain born Dar Disku Records takeover the playlist this week for a very exciting feature.

Standing not only as a record label, but also a DJ and art collective, Dar Disku have used their vast knowledge of middle eastern music and created some nostalgic fueled dance floor ready music that you are likely to hear played out in any vibrant club scene around the world.

The label is home to these incredibly catchy Arabic discotheque edits with productions by themselves, as well as Arabic- Irish producer @moving0still, the Netherlands @tjade.de.vries, and @freeshelterhki regular @getsomeaaro (Aaron Maple) of Finland. It has become a continental dance music movement.

Releases on the label have been played out by some very well-known heads in the industry, including @hunchmusic (Hunee), @dj_seinfeld, @jobjobse and @palmstrax, and been praised by the folks at @resident_advisor, @clashmagazine, and @mille_world. The latest collaborative edit from Moving Still and Tjade released on 'Dar Disku 004', Azza Kamal's 'Maadna Bukra' was one of our favorite sounds of 2020.

From Lisbon to Dublin, or Mumbai to Istanbul, the Dar Disku duo have played venues and festivals like @loveboxfestival across the globe. Their online- radio presence has seen them feature on @ccdisco 's @rinsestagram residency, @nabihahiqbal 's BBC Radio residency, @nts_radio, as well as becoming residents themselves on @worldwide.fm .
Let this week's 10 selekts from Dar Disku take you on a journey through hip hop, psychedelia, disco, new beat, and more.
