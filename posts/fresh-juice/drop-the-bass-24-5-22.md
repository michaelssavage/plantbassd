Splashing up sounds inspired by old school electro breaks and Miami hip-hop, Generator amasses Drexciya-esque elements with well expressioned electro and bass foundations. Already the third release of the calendar year for Canadian outfit Philthtrax, ‘Drop The Bass’ whacks up more intense, club friendly tracks than the releases that preceded it with the spaced out and gorgeously textured EP’s that came from Snarexx and and Plot Twist.

Title track ‘Drop The Bass’ kicks up a well established fuss from the get go with its clanging effects and shuffling electro breaks. Squidgy electro and acidic lines are brought up to Miami bass speed with fragments of hip-hop that help maintain a funkin’ groove throughout. A block-rocking track that could rip up any party!

‘Shake That’ takes on a slightly darker electro feel that ticks alongside strands of classic breakbeat and jungle. Sensual vocal samples and arcade style bleeps help to fuse the groove with the track’s more serious percussion.

Described by the Philthtrax family themselves as a sound that emerges from the depths of the Drexciyan ocean that makes a beeline for the shores of Miami. The label continues to build on their output of multi-dimensional electro that consistently takes listeners on a galactic journey.
