Since making the move to Scotland a year ago, Philly has not taken long to make their mark on the circuit securing slots alongside acts like TAAHLIAH and Martyn Bootyspoon, as well making headline appearances for Headset and EHFM at the Edinburgh famous Sneaky Pete’s Club.

‘For Sure’ arrives as the first release since Philly’s triumphant ‘Euphore’ (co-released with darkmavis) in 2021, and earmarks a slight shift in direction from their past jersey club and trance inspired hits.

‘For Sure’ takes an alluring bassline wobble that junctures with a pasty pumping house rhythm. Elements of jackin’ house and ballroom lilt the background and amount together in a feverish club friendly fashion.

This marks the first release back for Philly in what promises to be a busy end to the year into 2023. After receiving plaudits from the likes of Groove Armada, Giant Swan, Laurent Garnier, and Nina Kraviz on this record, whatever follows next is sure to keep you hot and bothered.
