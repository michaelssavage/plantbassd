PLUS ONE has proven himself to be a versatile producer and DJ. His range is ever expanding and this quick and dirty EP highlights his dedication to improving his sound using whatever inspiration he can find. In this case, it’s the sound of childhood racing games. The Irishman shines most with the use of atmospheric elements in his compositions and if you check out who creates most of his artwork, you can build a mental image of a blissful harmonious relationship between Matt and HIS plus one.

As the overseas movement in dance music draws toward more leftfield and bass sounds, PLUS ONE will be seen as one of the early Irish adopters of the sound. The Dublin native has crafted this sound from his experience playing around the Emerald Isle. He has worked with Kojaque on his debut album, appeared on Rinse FM, and worked with an eclectic sort of Irish artists like Glimmerman, Ema, Small Crab, and Sputnik One.

PLUS ONE takes four R&B hits from the past two years and creates some powerful arrangements to be heard in more intimate club settings. Each track is manipulated to give a complete new listening experience to the originals, reshaping the vocals into a new role in the tracks, and diverging from the original pop sound. The end result is an atmospheric EP filled with euphoric introspective vocals on top of dreamy textures.

The Flamenco R&B singer Rosalia has more than 50 millions listens on A Pale. The ‘A PALÉ (PLUS ONE EDIT)’ is a rapturous experience that accentuates the 808s used in the original tune. Matt creates a mystical listening experience with masterful use of reverb and echo building up into a hypnotic chorus.

Next up is a hot f\*\*kin track! IF I CRIED (PLUS ONE EDIT) gives us a huge jungle edit. PLUS ONE is pushing the BPM up on this one! Seriously mighty and wavy, this unreleased track from Charlie XCX gets the hyperpop treatment. Matt makes use of glitchy flangers and a tight phone-box type reverb on the vocal to give the tune a complete cosmetic overhaul. The incomprehensible vocals overlay a dizzying breakbeat that keeps evolving throughout the track. It’s massive!

Doja Cat is one of the biggest names in the world right now because of how she has gelled her quirky personality and musical prowess together so well. STREETS (PLUS ONE EDIT) takes the original cozy, introspective offering from Doja Cat, and shifts the mood to be more pronounced, soothing and spacy. We would have liked the low-end to be more commanding on this track but it makes up for it by creating an expansive hall of reverbs and powerful percussion loops pushing the energy all the way up.

Giveon is the type of artist to make you ugly cry. He is not bound to any constraints and constantly shows his affinity for music. HEARTBREAK ANNIVERSARY (PLUS ONE EDIT) sticks up two fingers at that original slow-burning soulful offering and creates a leftfield dubby banger. The drums and synth swell up until eventually accumulating into a two-stepping release. The final edit on the EP puts the vocal on the backfoot and instead unleashes a hefty instrumental akin to early Floating Points.
