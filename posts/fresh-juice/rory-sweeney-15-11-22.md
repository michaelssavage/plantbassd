Forging himself into one of Ireland’s most sought after producers and DJs over the last few years, Rory Sweeney has constantly pushed beyond boundaries with his sound amassing everything from footwork to trap, odes to 90s UK jungle, trickles of gabber and hardcore and even taking on film scores.

Trash Catalogue Part 1 as described by Sweeney himself is rooted in ‘nature and cinematic sound palletes’. The basis of the 8 tracks comes from field recordings, a slight move away from the club and hip-hop paradigms of his previous works. For Rory, this was music that he has always wanted to make. It doesn't sound completely unfamiliar to the sounds that have gone before, but there is a greater sense of maturity in this project. It almost feels like the next level has been unlocked in Sweeney’s productions.

As always a frequent collaborator, some familiar names and friends join in on Trash Catalogue with the likes of EMBY, E the Artist, and Curtisy all reappearing as well as contributions from Pippa Molony & TXPE_EATER.

Part 1 opens with the concoction of noise and energy that is ‘The Storm’. Almost operating as a loading screen, the album opener melds rich jungle breaks with sun rising vocal and background arrangements. A perfect storm if you will of percussion and uprising melodies.

Lead single ‘Spring Came’ follows accompanied by a chilling vocal performance from Pippa Molony. Entwined with a manipulated sampling of a river flow in 1970s Brazil, ‘Spring Came’ creates an image of rebirth alongside Molony’s soothing lyrics at a footwork pacing that brings Trash Catalogue into life.

Rising Irish hip-hop sensation Curtisy once again allies with Sweeney on ‘Veggies’. A darker atmosphere than the opening 2 tracks, ‘Veggies’ falls somewhere between trap beats and Tim Reaper-esque jungle fills and key patterns. Curtisy’s by now distinct vocals are enriched by a tinny EQing that allows both the instrumentals and lyrics to coexist in a cocoon of gurgling energy.

London via Belfast, EMBY enters with his effortless ooze on the stuttering trip-hop of ‘Dip’. Rory once again emits his dedication to the craft of seamlessness here running the track at an eased out pace with elements of lo-fi house and grime accompanying a layering of slick breakbeats by the end.

The atmosphere becomes subdued on ‘Image Wavering’, exploring a deeper core within the album as a mirage of wavering sounds come clashing together as the Dublin native uncovers a more ambient side.

‘Rain’ sees E the Artist and TXPE_EATER enter the catalogue on this snapshot of drill accompanied by outdoor city sampling that captures a wet dreary day in Dublin that becomes polarized in a spaced out hip-hop dimension.

Opening track ‘The Storm’ is redefined with the ‘Local God’s After the Storm Mix’ with Rory once again channeling an ambient yet textured exploration of sound. It almost acts as a 12 minute meditation that takes you away from the album for a snapshot. Quite an addictive listen that melds together a city’s landscape with bass throbbings and screeching effects.

‘Dafuzz’ closes out part 1 of Sweeney’s debut feature length triumph with a bending voyage through computer game samples, enchanted by some UKG formatted goodness. A track that bounces in such an innocent way yet maintaining a crafty beat shuffle throughout, it ignites the ever so slightest of gun fingers with each listen.

As multi-dimensional as Sweeney has been in the past, this has to be his most diverse direction in sound yet. Encompassing layers of ambient electronica via field recordings with trinkets of jungle, UKG, footwork and more, it is made very difficult to nail down any one genre to the tracks.

This is Rory Sweeney’s world and we’re all just lucky enough to be living in it. Thankfully this is only part 1, and we have a further 8 tracks to explore on part 2 coming December 1st.
