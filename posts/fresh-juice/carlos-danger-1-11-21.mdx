An ode to the sounds of the 90s UK scene with trickles of Baltimore, breakcore and footwork, Sweeney effortlessly transcends through 132 to 195 bpm, telling the story of these definitive genres in dance music along the way.

A true whirlwind of sounds from the @bittentwicecollective 's very own, Sweeney continues to carve out his status as one of Ireland's most talented and sought after producers with this installment. You can expect to hear more sounds like this in the future under the new Carlos Danger moniker.
