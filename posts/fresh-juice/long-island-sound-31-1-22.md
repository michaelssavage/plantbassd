Hailing from Dublin, the duo have created a phenomenal release of ambient and pulsing cuts that find tranquil moments in space throughout.

Lead single _Memory_ weaves at a hypnotic pace from start to finish. The bassline ducks and moves around an arp line glued together with a pumping kick to make this track a highlight to watch out for at their next show. The accompanying video is a mind-melting trip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNH0UsVg5j0.

_First Contact_ and _Wind & Rain_ layer delayed drums that give space to construct gorgeous progressive melodies. Both tracks build to their own zenith before leaving the journey back down weightless and shimmering. From being in the crowd at Long Island Sound's show at CABAL Limerick last year, we had an instant admiration for both Rob and Tim's skills for calculated construction of musical textures and energy flow throughout their set.

_Aurora_ reminds us of that night. A smooth track of two parts, The first commanded by a vocal sample and drum groove working against it, and the second half by a filter-controlled arp that has us holding our breaths for a release.

_Komorebi_ details a swaggering frenetic acid line and a relaxed ambient groove underneath. A standout favourite of ours coming in at 4.31 minutes, it is the shortest track but most impactful!
