### Cork-born and Edinburgh-based producer HhÉiR arrives with his debut EP on Irish label Verve. Two tracks of momentary bliss that drift between electro, bass, funky, and atmospheric club.

Constructed during the challenging nights of lockdown with an Akai APC and a range of samples, the Preminal EP began to take its shape, as too did the HhÉiR (Olan Cahill) moniker.
Hoping to amass a sound that captured the distant atmosphere of clubs at the time, Olan has arranged two elating yet healing tracks that lean heavy on well grooved percussion and soothing melodies.

'001' channels an earthy tone that is met with growing bass lines and hard kicks. Consistent hats and claps allow the track to maintain its rhythm as the melody develops and takes flight into a soaring procession of euphoric, slow-fading keys.

After we received an early demo of 'Hang My Hat', it's striking percussion and chord progression was instantly evident. Drum patterns that weave between UK funky and more steady tribal kicks set the tone as the domineering synth-line deftly takes over.

After a decade or so plying his trade in Cork's club scene with the hip-hop collective 'Cuttin' Heads', Olan's change in direction soundwise appears a seamless transition with this quality production. A chance meeting with Verve member Oisín Kelly in an Edinburgh barber shop led to the record finding a home. Now a fruitful journey awaits as HhÉiR unlocks his sound, ready for club exposure at last.
