Since 2016, HEADSGONE has been in and around music production in one way or another be it with early SoundCloud hip hop instrumentals or summer time lifting house. 7 years down the line and it appears the Cork native has found the right stroke between track layering, weight and overall progression.

‘Where’d It Go’ arrives off the back of last year's house-focused <HoverLink url="soundcloud.com/headsgone/headsgone-360-modded-master" name="‘360’" external /> EP and the more recent collaboration with Lwny on <HoverLink url="open.spotify.com/track/45iy9utPsCxWmtFmoYBK0B" name="'Drive Me Crazy'" external />, a Rudimental-esque DnB runner.

HEADSGONE now manoeuvers in a different direction, dropping his house shackles and finding freedom within intelligent breakbeats and organic hand drums amongst elegant strings and focusing vocals on ‘Where’d It Go’.

Clearly taking inspiration from figures like Bonobo and Four Tet, the Corkonian’s latest single signals a more mature sound cementing these ethereal elements with the club in mind using rave friendly breakbeats and MC interjections.

The track is accompanied by cutting edge AI constructed visuals <HoverLink url="www.youtube.com/shorts/eGyUfj9fVJA" external name="(See Here)"/> and marks an anticipatory start to the year for the artist who promises to deliver on a rigorous release schedule throughout 2023.
