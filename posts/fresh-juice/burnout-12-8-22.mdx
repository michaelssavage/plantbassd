A regular face on the Dublin club circuit for some years now, breaks and bass heart throb Burnout has been cutting his teeth in the scene with previous releases on revered Irish underground imprints such as VSN and Midlands League.

Kicking it since the Hangar days, most recently he has graced Bow Lane Social with Exceltek as well as spearheading Portlaoise all-dayer, Súil Charad with some of the country's most prominent heads in Pauline and Small Bear to name but a few.

Burnout shines on this club friendly two tracker amassing tightly screwed break patterns and neat samples, packing a really lovable punch.

Luv 2 Luv U grooves on a souped up breakbeat that is met with timely deep lying kicks. The sensual vocals of the Destiny's Child classic 'Naughty Girl' linger in the background fittingly alongside the Dub's menacing break patterns. A track that wouldn't go a miss on the likes of Club Glow.

'Do It Right' spins up a similarly nostalgic hit with Far East Movement's 'Like a G6' getting the Burnout treatment. A deep ridged atmospheric build up is once again met with titanic breaks and cutting bass lines that are poised to rattle the dark rooms and basements.

Tracks to tear your set a new one, these are likely to shapeshift crowds into a frenzy at any given time or place.
