### Almost exactly a year on from his debut ‘Preliminal’ EP, Cork native HhÉiR returns with his sophomore effort on the leftfield bass triumph of ‘Kairos’.

A slight move away from the atmospheric electro foundations of ‘Preliminal’, ‘Kairos’ sees the now Glasgow residing HhÉiR tackle bass and dubstep mutations with 4 tracks of tripped out, percussive fuelled energy.

Acting as the EP’s opener, ‘Move Different’ combines Eastern inspired strings with finely balanced hand drums that become stripped down by a hovering sub bass, spacing vocals and subdued bleeps.

‘First Contact’ opens us up to the Corkonian’s dubstep influence. 140 weaponry, the track creates a weighted tension from the get go with its thundering kicks and robust bass lines which eventually crash into an arrangement of breakbeats and inducing vocal samples.

Title-track ‘Kairos’ sees the return of a selection of organic drums crossing over with a more dubstep direction that then slips into a percussive tribal flow.

Fizzy breakbeats emerge from an initially high frequency landing on closing number ‘Gerrup’ before moving into a lively hard groove rhythm on what is an uplifting climactic moment on ‘Kairos’.

A strong independent release from an Irish producer on the rise, HhÉiR’s sound is becoming further polished with every release. An ability to phase in and out of multiple rhythm dimensions within single tracks, be it dubstep into tribal or breakbeat into hard groove only compliments further the developing nature of his sound. We’ll be keeping our ear to the ground for what comes next.
