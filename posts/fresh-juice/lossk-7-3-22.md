After recently forming Bad Era Records in his home of Brighton, Lossk joins the growing Hyperdome records after developing an avid taste for electro sounds in recent years. ‘Electrophile’ lands as the 8th release on the now well established Hyperdome Records, which has expanded from its club night origins over time with founder DJ Bastard at the helm. The Lossk release falls on the label after previous efforts from the likes of YTP, mod-R, Mister Sticktalk, & more.

Electrophile initializes with opening track ‘Ballistix’ which surges with atmospheric synth lines and high pitched snares. This background leads in seamlessly to a more bass driven breakdown with kicks that gain weight throughout.

Stepping up the pace, ‘Ghetto Bird’ slaps up a swift 808 electro shuffle with more towering bass lines and synth trinkets. Mean cyborg samples and acidic shots add to this dark tempered roller.

Squidgy kicks stomp on ‘Holicron Bop’ and are heaved forward by chasing bass belts and berzerk acid lines. A hyperactive electro racer that momentarily ceases fire before restoring its frantic energy.

Lossk’s ferocity remains on ‘Lick Da Butt’ which is another hurried bass dash that hums along a well crafted 808 path.

‘Spotchka’ reels the pace in slightly from the previous tracks, whilst maintaining the calamitous vigour that Lossk has captured throughout ‘Electrophile’ as it comes to its close. From it’s core, it spills out into an acid battle before somehow finding control again.

5 testing acid and bass fuelled electro tracks from Lossk on the London bound Hyperdome imprint.
