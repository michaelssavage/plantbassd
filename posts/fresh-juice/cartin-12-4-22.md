### The Derry electronic sensation delivers his next body of work with the new self released EP ‘U Got My Numder? / Endz’.

Once again, Cartin embodies a range of eclectic percussion, vocals, and instrumental arrangements that emerge as high energy club tracks amassing dub techno and tightly knit breaks.

One of the most exciting talents to emerge from the north of Ireland in recent memory, Cartin’s stock is bolstered even further with this release after his memorable 2021 ‘Bunk’ entry on Belfast label Nocturne. If that release hadn’t caught your attention, then his rip-roaring guitar fuelled Boiler Room live set at the latest edition of AVA Festival certainly should have.

This release from Cartin solidifies that gritty yet well polished sound that he has come to establish himself with over the past two years. A multi-instrumentalist that is flipping the rule book of electronic production, this two track triumph delivers the wall of sound that Cartin typically fuses. His personal instrumental efforts along with well programmed effects and samples have proven to consistently develop into high octane club trax.

‘U Got My Number?’ introduces the EP with an entourage of choppy breaks and eastern elements that trail alongside a humming bassline as sharp, snappy, yet twisted vocals wriggle their way into the body of the track. All of this carnage is then met by swerving brass samples at the breakdown which distills the track’s energy before returning to the infectious initial calamity. Imagine yourself in a sea of New Delhi traffic, and that is the kind of energy that ‘U Got My Number?’ manages to aurally deliver.

‘Endz’ quite similarly enters the fray with more sharp, choppy breaks that echo with a more intimate and natural slap. The domineering bass line that follows is freshly brewed from the Derry native’s Stratocaster. Its presence alongside the tongue in cheek hip hop vocals intertwine to shift the songs energy into becoming a well oiled breakbeat techno smacker that could ignite any set or crowd.

Armed with a Push 2, a Moog Sub 37, a Behringer DeepMind 12, his Strat, and a chunky bass, Cartin dispatches his envisioned raw and grittier sound on this release. Having previously featured the Derry man on our Spotify Takeover series ([see here](https://www.plantbassd.com/takeovers/cartin-14-10-21)) and been lucky enough to catch his live set at the most recent edition of Celtronic, it was a pleasure to land on the next turn of Cartin’s sound. It leaves us itching for more and begs the question of where can he push his sound to next? Keep your eyes open for this man. There is plenty more to come.
