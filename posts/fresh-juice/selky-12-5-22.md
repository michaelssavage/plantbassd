After a string of notable releases in 2021, including the Moveltraxx released hit ‘Night Czar’ and the pulsating remix of Gemma Dunleavy’s ‘Return’, Selky (Cian Murphy) initiates into 2022 with this bubbling edit pack. A name-your-price 4 tracker that shakes up global hits from Phil Collins, Nelly Furtado, and more.

A member of the forward thinking trifecta that is Club Comfort alongside Roo Honeychild and Baliboc, Selky and his peers have been pushing the typical club ideals in Ireland to new depths in the last number of years. Offering up spaces for inclusivity and the more intriguing sounds in club land, they have breathed new life into the Irish scene with their love of US club, ballroom, baile, funky, and all things hot.

The sounds amassed on The Bumps are typical of what you could expect to hear at a Club Comfort party, especially in one of Cian’s innovative sets.

First up, ‘Earth Sleeps’ takes on the anthemic Peter Gabriel and Deep Forest track ‘While The Earth Sleeps, maintaining the original’s atmosphere and euphoric feel. Selky adds a more consistent club feel with tight knit break patterns and stable kicks.

‘Paradise’ follows and this time it is Phil Collins undergoing the Selky treatment with his reworking of ‘Another Day’. The Collins classic is given a blissful Baltimore facelift that is screaming out to the summer’s fast approaching festival season and inevitable park drinking day sessions. We premiered this track on our Soundcloud here: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/plantbassddjs/plant-bassd-premiere-selky-paradise-the-bumps-ep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Plant Bassd Premiere: Selky - Paradise</a>

‘Northern Lights’ conjures more angelic melodies and backgrounds against some tightly screwed breaks. A more relaxed blend in its energy and delivery which ebbs and flows with reappearing key lines and effects. A real no nonsense breakbeat number.

Closing out this 4 track triumph sees Selky tackle a track that is no stranger to a flip in Nelly Furtado’s ‘Say It Right’. Furtado’s insatiable vocals are met with a commanding break from Selky that slowly but surely bridges with the other influential elements of the hit. The drums lean more towards the Baltimore side as the track progresses, becoming more floor filling with every verse.

A very solid first release of the year from the Dub, all designed for the club and the dancers that occupy them. One of the good guys, Selky provides these club-friendly tools at a pocket-friendly price, but it would be immoral not to patronize these tracks.
