The first release from unknown producer Capricorn One, HEADSET 002 runs amok through shuffling sounds of dubstep, bass and garage house.

The steadied rattle of 'Random Systems Inc.' opens up the sounds with a heady layer of revolving bass and dubby kicks. Alluring vocals and other sound bytes kindly cloud the background on this half time hammer.

Another chuggy dub number, 'System One' hazes subtly in and out of snippets of MC's and further chopped up samples whilst maintaining a firm line of low ended kicks throughout.

'Clean Up' is presented with an inviting tribal sequence that crashes courses with the by now distinct divulse bass chop of Capricorn One. Perhaps the standout of the bunch, the ebbing throb that the sound creates makes it a real mouth-watering club prospect.

A move away from the opening bass mechanics of the EP'S first 3 quarters, 'Cheeky Bam' closes out HEADSET002 with a groove-fixated garage house sound that oozes along with an early UK inspired high hat shuffle and rotating snares.

HEADSET has well and truly initialized into its label form with its second project of the year kicking on from where things started with its debut release from Creep Woland back in May.

2023 promises to be an exciting calendar year for the imprint with a clear dedicated following starting to form for the Skillis backed imprint.
