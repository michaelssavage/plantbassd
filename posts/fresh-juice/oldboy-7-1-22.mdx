### Sheffield's Oldboy arrives with another quadruplet of grime laced breaks, dubstep, and garage instrumentals. The sequel that no one asked for says Oldboy, but one we most definitely think we deserved!

The initial 'Grimey Ones' effort (listen: <HoverLink url="oldboytrax.bandcamp.com/album/grimey-ones" external inline />) caught our attention last summer along with the ridiculous 128kpbs releases that the steel city based artist fronts with mates Phasmid, Xander, Papa Nugs, and Longeez, have firmly put Oldboy on our release radar.

Grimey Ones Part II introduces itself with a dark and shuffling dubstep effort in the shape of 'LUV U', which maintains a groove throughout with its consistent breaks and snappy voiceovers. Lead single 'LOOSE SHELLS' runs riot with a chippy 2 step rhythm that overlaps with Flowdan's 'Shell A Verse' for a truly mad ting!

'TOO MANY CLANGS' brings a heavy wobble fit enough to disturb any soundsystem which is given a helping hand from a Wiley classic. Closing out this 4 track triumph is 'CREEPIN THRU THE JUNGLE' which rolls an ear tingling, destructive break that stutters against more familiar souped up grime lyrics.

The EP is available to stream and purchase on Bandcamp now. Here's hoping we are treated to more tuff trax from Oldboy and the growingly dominable UK midlands scene throughout 2022 and beyond.
