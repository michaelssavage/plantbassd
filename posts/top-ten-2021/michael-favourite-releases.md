Lots of euphoric electronic sounds in my top picks this year. Spent a lot of time with some feel-good house, breakbeats, and club music with some room for heavies along the way.

## 1. Shire T - Tomorrow’s People (Dama Dama Music)

My album of the year, Tomorrow’s People is incredibly futuristic and nostalgic. Not a moment gone to waste in this bustling soundscape that glues together UK Garage, breakbeat, acid house and more! We’ve got some serious dancefloor fillers in the form of _Full Attention_, _Blue Kiss_, and _Burnin’ Jungle_.

At the tail end of this album, we say farewell with _London. Paris. Berlin._ and _Serve No Tea_. Delightful piano melodies. This is a must-listen.

## 2. Eris Drew - Quivering In Time (T4T LUV NRG)

</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

Samples, tricks, vocal chops, sound effects condensed into a restless hour of music story-telling. This album is rich with life and each song acts a mini-mix as they evolve over their track life.

Drew and her partner, Octo Octa, have a vast knowledge of rave music and they have plenty they want to share with the world. This album is so expressive of their feelings and it becomes more pleasurable to listen to when you learn some context to who they are and what they do.

## 3. Laurence Guy - Your Good Times Are Here (Shall Not Fade)

</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

Your Good Times Are Here has two feel-good House thumpers accompanied by slowed-down reflections.

Tracks 1 & 3 capture the celebration of moving to normality again through dance music while tracks 2 & 4 offer a sombre retrospective look at the past two years.

I adore this EP and it ultimately makes me feel more positive after each listen.

</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

Lxury is one of my favourite artists. Each tune is a guaranteed joy to listen to. The London producer creates summery, easy-to-digest tracks that have some experimental features sprinkled here and there so I have high hopes for every new release. My expectations were matched and more for his latest EP as each track was oozing with euphoric bounciness.

<img src="/top-ten-2021/michael/blawan-woke_up_right_handed.jpg" alt="Blawan EP cover art" width="60%" />
</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

A dark brewing EP of monstrous and evolving sounds. There’s an intense roaring low-end throughout that disregards club music conventions. Pioneering as ever, Blawan is leading his own path in terms of sound design.

There’s something so mesmerizing about the textures and unique style that Blawan is recognizable for. Extra reading about his studio: [studiospc]("https://www.studiospc.de/project/blawan")

<div class="col clubGuide">

Jack of all trades, Roman Flugel, is a multi-genre producer. He first landed on my radar after hearing the massive Italo dance hit, Garden Party, last year. Cluttered Homes sits upfront and noticeable in an otherwise melancholy and ambient EP. The track is dark too but is driven with more urgency. Helped along by a hypnotic acid line that I just can’t get enough of.

<div class="col clubGuide">

I fell in love with this track because of the way I first consumed it. It’ll surprise me every time I hear it based on that initial experience I had. I was driving late across the country and stuck it on in the car and the gorgeous synths panned left and right across the speakers. I was stunned by how blissful it was.

FitzGerald says: _“Ultraviolet came together over several long nights alone in the studio, dreaming about rushing to the furthest place I could imagine at the fastest speed possible. Firing through space at 1000s of miles an hour without moving.”_

## 8. Model Man (Self-titled LP) - (Mahogany Records)

<div class="col clubGuide">
<img src="/top-ten-2021/michael/model_men_lp.jpg" alt="Model Man LP cover art" width="60%" />
</div>
<div class="col clubGuide">

_“Harmony is the musical element that comes the most naturally to me.”_ Model Man’s first album release is full to the brim with beautiful melodies fused with visceral energy. Model Man came from a Mormon upbringing so a lot of that classical gospel-like sound can be heard seeping through each track.

Religion and his moving on from that part of his life into rave culture play a huge part in the themes of this LP. Euphoric and nostalgic like Tomorrow’s People.

Elliot Adamson’s new project sees the release of nine mammoth tracks. The album samples some real groovy vocals and fits them into unforgettable club bangers.

There’s much to love in this album but what stood out to me was the raw emotion and pure magic that’s on display in Need A Friend, similar to For Those I Love.
