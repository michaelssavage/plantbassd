  As Spotify increases its prices, it becomes more apparent that the Music Service is on a decline. The streaming giant cannot find a way to make good profits and they have started to cast as large a net as possible with different functionalities in the app. It’s the inevitable ‘enshittification’ that happens to companies after they hit their peak. I digress here but I think it’s relevant to a point that this track has seen some amazing feedback on TikTok but the reception and amount of plays on Spotify have been pretty terrible. 
Jersey went viral in July with ‘Tomorrow Never Comes’ as it features a delicious hook along with high energy button mashing like Fred Again’s signature move. Its popularity is being replicated by big names like Disclosure too but this track is flying right under the radar on music services. TikTok, which is soon looking to release their own music streaming platform, will be another disruptor to Spotify and iTunes. That’s a whole other article to get into.

  Look, I’m sorry but my guilty pleasure is a good Jackin House/ Tech House banger. Apologies
  especially to the anti tech-house crew but these no-frills bangers with classic House vocals are
  FUN. Simple but effective use of the grooviest of basslines with an old-school kick and snare
  pattern is all that's needed here to get any dancefloor going.

>
  “Three varied, mutant workouts for soundsystem immersion.” Sneaker Social Club have done a pretty
  good job of summing up this EP from Low End Activist. We’ve got a twitchy array of sounds here,
  the sort that invokes that face scrunching-up feeling. There’s a menace to this production with
  preference gone to harsh, clanging noises and slow dub basses.

  embed="album=4266658333"
>
  The most genuine guys and hardest workers in the Irish electronic scene have been releasing tracks for a decade now and they add two new atmospheric rave offerings to their stacked trophy cabinet. The duo are playing at All Together Now Festival this weekend and we are absolutely craving to hear their melodic rich set.

Arcadia ‘Bug’ stage at 9pm on Sunday. Be there for a great time.

  Chicago 🤝 Kyoto
Insane levels of energy from Jun Kamoda’s new release will leave you excited and wanting more. It’s a very special ensemble of crashing drums, warm synth pads and pounding kick drums being pushed to the limit with class FX. ‘Last Tune From The Rocks’ is mesmerizing stuff.

>
  An Avrin’s release makes it to our under the radar once again with some Leftfield bass gone
  freaky. IAMN01 is no stranger to sampling quirky and is in serious form at the moment. Catch him
  this Sunday at Sneaky Pete’s for a monstrous set with Smiff and Lara Sinclair.

  fund for trans people who are out of work or struggling curated by Henry Earnest. The expansive
  range of sounds are gelled together with the cutesy pop sounds that come from Earnest’s original

  F**K! The original brings me a brilliant joy and this welcoming facelift from Star Slinger is so
  playful and compelling. I (Michael) will have this on repeat for a long time.

  standout="In a Moment Divine"
  embed="album=3614187337"
>
  Laid back welcoming hues of colour in this Freak Heat Waves album. ‘In a Moment Divine’ caught our
  attention first with its familiar jagged synth sounds akin to Bicep and Ross From Friends.
  ‘Endless’ rides along on a breakbeat and shimmering chords, while ‘How Do We Come Alive’, ‘Off My
  Mind’, ‘Altered States’, and ‘Mondo Tempo’ chill out with slower psychedelic jams.

>
  Glasgow’s Hang Tough label landed with their second release of the year from fellow citizen Hngwy.
  ‘Flee’ travels through the darker dimensions of electro, techno and bass with 4 tracks of low end
  pummels travelling within the 100-160bpm region. For those intense, dark and dubby club
  situations.

  titleLink="https://allergyseason.bandcamp.com"

>
  Deep and weighted house from two Allergy Season mainstays in Physical Therapy & Complete
  Walkthrough, ‘Popcorn’ is a sensually hypnotic 3 tracker of timely bass lines and 808
  configurations. Simplistic in its design but deadly in its nature, these are crucial early hours
  numbers.

  title="Dusk EP by Pusher"

  embed="album=2516385334"
>
  Dublin’s Pusher has cracked the knack of producing anthemic house tools in recent years, with the
  piano led Dusk EP operating no differently. Combining finely tuned percussion layers with
  uplifting chords and bass lines, this is yet another self-released slasher made for sun-tinged
  evenings at festivals and clubs alike. Proper outdoorsy House this!

  embed="track=4267259209"
>
  A speedy g OG! Paul Rayner continues to pull the strings behind modern day organ house, niche,
  bassline and speed garage. ‘ALONE’ samples the heavenly lyrics of SWV’s ‘Weak’ on this hi-hat
  fuelled garage kicker and it’s a bit of a bloody lively one. A step back in time once again from
  Rayner.

  Hyperpop to catwalk ready bass house with a sprinkling of ballroom. It's all packed into this
  latest dosage of Doss and it's kind of perfect.

>
  Carnival crazy from Mexico’s 10010. ‘DISCOLATINO’ ramps up an electrifying potion of salsa,
  merengue and mambo with hard house and techno intermissions. Pure club rocket fuel across 6 tub
  thumpers.
