  title="Dance Trax Vol. 50 by Denham Audio"

  standout="‘Do You Sell Hardcore?’"

>
  Ahead of his appearance at Ar Ais Arís this weekend in Galway, we were listening to Denham Audio’s
  4 part breakbeat release. The EP’s main elements revolve around soft glimmering compositions
  before getting into the nitty gritty rave sounds. There’s good usage of samples throughout with
  one interesting one coming from Anthony Hopkins in Westworld when he’s talking about
  Consciousness. Our pick is ‘Do You Sell Hardcore?’ with its water droplet-like noises and
  thunderous kicks.

  title="At The Altar / On A Superbike by Lxury"
  link="https://lxury.bandcamp.com/album/at-the-altar-on-a-superbike"
  titleLink="https://lxury.bandcamp.com"
  standout="'TT' or 'LF1 ft. Vondelpark & Lucky I'm Luke'"
  embed="album=2984551095"
>
  Lxury is carving his own path with his blend of energetic dance music that has layers upon layers
  of rich joyous sounds. Each track uses buttery smooth vocal snippets like those in ‘If You Ever’,
  ‘Oblivion’ and ‘TT’. ‘LF1 ft. Vondelpark & Lucky I'm Luke’ is a strong call for love with powerful
  lyrics akin to the euphoric feeling created by Joy Anonymous.

  title="Everything Is Curly by Karenn"
  link="https://karenn.bandcamp.com/album/everything-is-curly"
  titleLabel="(Voam)"
  titleLink="https://voam.bandcamp.com/"
  standout="'Happy Birthday'"
  embed="album=962493101"
>
  ‘Feeling Horizontal’ wouldn’t sound amiss as a release from Blawan alone, but this is the combined
  efforts of Blawan and Pariah for their label Voam. It’s squelchy, bassy, and erotic. ‘Happy
  Birthday’ gives you the feeling of trudging along in heavy mud with thick basses and a peppy
  whistle sound. ‘From Hunk To Husk’ does not stray away from the pattern created in the first two
  tracks with more rippling basses and an additional uncomfortable noise of what sounds like a
  balloon about to burst. ‘When Lutes Were a Thing’ races to the finish of the EP with plucked
  basses and flangers at a high tempo.

  titleLabel="(Hessle Audio)"
  titleLink="https://hessleaudio.bandcamp.com/"
  embed="track=2455296198"
>
  Olof Dreijer offers dancing ear-worms that fill every space of sound and colour. It has light and
  bouncy synths dissipating around a bass that gets more involved over the track’s life. The album
  is just as bright and colourful with very satisfying colours and textures.

  title="'Exotic Golfcourse' by Special Request x Mumdance"
  link="https://gudurecords.bandcamp.com/album/exotic-golfcourse"
  titleLabel="(Gudu Records)"
  titleLink="gudurecords.bandcamp.com"
>
  A return to the 'Vortex' sound from Special Request, this was initially a Mumdance remix of
  Special Request's Erotic Discourse but turned eventually into its own thing. It's a mind-melting
  ego-death of 6 minutes with handbrake turns and donuts in the midst of it all. Heard in sets for
  the past year, it gets its release and the full EP release in early July.

  titleLabel="(Unknown To The Unknown)"
  titleLink="https://unknowntotheunknown.bandcamp.com"
  standout="'No More'"
  embed="album=1835336425"
>
  2 track release with busy sliding basslines in No More and thumping kicks in Setting Me Free. The housemeister creates funky movers by chopping up fun vocal snippets with piano stabs.

>
  Our Under The Radar top pick for June goes to Kevin McHugh (also going by Ambivalent). He is seen
  ais a ‘reliable voice on underground dancefloors around the world’ and has played in New York,
  Barcelona, Paris, and Berlin where he now resides. LA-4A’s day to day life owning and operating a
  full service audio post-production mixing and mastering studio, Valence Studio, gives you an idea
  of what sort of experimental and rich sounds he will be able to produce. The 11 tracks range in
  tempo and energy but some standouts are the bass driven tracks like ‘Deep Down Karma Hounds’,
  ‘Swordfish’ and ‘Outgesourct’. Folio, or be it Kevin’s Portfolio, is a solid album to get the
  headphones on for.

  Record Label Grid gathers a compilation of thirteen tracks from prominent artists in the bass
  scene. Strong tracks in particular from Ronan with ‘Shadowbox’ and Jabes with ‘Gaol Figure’. The
  highest quality productions from Grid on this one.

  titleLink="https://sambinga.bandcamp.com"
  standout="'Wicked Set'"
  embed="album=3418567134"
>
  “Not dubstep, no DnB” is the description given for this EP from the Bristol natives. What do we
  have then? A mix of bass goodiness from the likes of Drill rapper SBA Karma hopping into the ring
  in ‘Any Weather’ for a boxing match with an evolved grime beat and MC Jakes contributing vocals to
  punchy ‘Wicked Set’. Slow bangers that hit hard.

  titleLink="https://micronaudio.bandcamp.com"

>
  DJ Stingray’s Micron Audio is one imprint we always keep a watchful eye on. If futuristic
  mechanised electro is your thing, there really is no better place to look. Belgium’s 6SISS is next
  in line with the incredible electroids of BOTS. Inspired by our increasingly technologically
  advancing world, BOTS soundtracks a not too distant future set to be defined by Machine Learning
  and Natural Language Processing with 4 incredible strips of clone techno and industrial electro.

  embed="album=2467938877"
>
  Danish hard dance enigma HEDO HYDR8 coughs up yet another panel beating instalment of the IDENTITY
  SAMPLER series. Armed with two kick heavy electro-tek thumpers in 'BLOOD DANCER' and 'PIERCER',
  with the former receiving the remix treatment from none other than Amor Satyr, HYDR8 pushes the
  limits of heavy once more on this blitzing collection of sound system testers.

  titleLink="https://rawppl.bandcamp.com/"
  standout="DJ Plant Texture - HighSpeedLife"
  embed="album=2158050580"
>
  RAW’s summer series returns with more sun soaked hard funk groovers from acts like Pagan, Bours?,
  Bad Boombox & more. An increasingly essential compilation that gathers greater stead with each
  year, this edition sees the first in the series to feature original productions, a move away from
  the previous fun lovin’ summer edits that have soundtracked past festival seasons. Don’t worry!
  They still slap just as hard! (If not more..)

>
  Mining elements of XTC Factory’s ‘Take Me Away’ with Strike’s club classic ‘U Sure Do’, Bogotá’s
  BRENDA fuses his growingly signature guaracha Club with a sprinkling of LATAM pop on this quirky
  ode to rave inspired by their recent touring of Europe.

  embed="album=397645111"
>
  Influential Czech label Genot Centre closes its doors after 8 years in the dance supplying
  unconventional club trax from a roster that has boasted seminal acts like KAVARI, HDMIRROR & Lišaj
  to name but a few. Bryce Helms produces the 53rd and final release on the imprint with an
  otherworldly collection of fever dreams that digest everything from hard house, glitch bass,
  distortia and breakcore in a most symbiotic, mutational fashion.

  titleLink="https://wnclrecordings.bandcamp.com"
  embed="album=24720809"
>
  Tunnel chasing fast breaks from the menacing HOOVERIAN BLUR released courtesy of UK bass stalwarts
  WNCL. Hard ass techno and jungle hybrids from an artist capable of sending crowds and listeners
  alike to dimensions far beyond with their unique twist on the breakbeat.

  titleLink="https://sneakersocialclub.bandcamp.com/"
  standout="'Carnage'"
  embed="album=1291720555"
>
  Fuckin ‘ell! Just your average Sneaker Social release at this stage. Breakbeat ballistics from
  Trends & Boylan (plus a Slimzee featuring) who carve out a series of head rattling organic drum
  runs across an underlying throttle of dubstep foundation. The weight of bass here is a frightening
  prospect that seems to only gather greater momentum with each passing track.

  titleLink="https://fiestasoundsystem.bandcamp.com"
  embed="album=3204455140"
>
  A selection of workings unusual from the typical releases of Fiesta Soundsystem, trading in his
  familiar breaks and bass explorations for an experimentation in breakcore, ambient and IDM. These
  are a collection of off kilter productions that the UK producer has been coughing up since 2021
  and it’s an interesting listen to say the least.

  Montreal’s audio bambino has been delivering a consistent flow of alternative dance music structures since its foundation in 2020. Portugal footwork favourite Mujipuki only adds to their pristine back catalogue with a fun punch of juke & footwork on this two tracker of love ‘n bass \<3. ‘She Made Us Drinks’ comes accompanied with an endearing coming of age music video recently  shot in Glasgow by Ben Mc

  titleLink="https://djbabatr.bandcamp.com"
  embed="album=3748048228"
>
  The creator of the engrossing raptor house sound, Venezuela’s Dj Babatr shares two original
  productions of his typical high energy sound with a host of remixes from club heroes such as
  Kode9, Badsista, Florentino & more. The punchy Changa sound undergoes an incredible series of
  fusions with footwork, baile funk, trance & beyond.

>
  An absolute riot of a track from Janaway on the ever impressive London based Racket Recordings.
  Fusing Brazilian funk and jungle, ‘Changa Chant’ creates a force field of ricocheting snares and
  pummelling bass with destructive tendencies. A proper system killer!
