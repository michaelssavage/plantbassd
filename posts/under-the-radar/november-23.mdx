  title="Lovexpress77 by TTeo"
  link="https://tteosk.bandcamp.com/album/lovexpress77"
  standout="Follow Me"
  embed="album=2836632751"
>
  TTeo is the moniker of Matteo Capreoli, a half German half Italian singer, songwriter,
  multi-instrumentalist, and producer. That’s a mouthful! This is easily one of my (Michael)
  favourite releases of 2023 as it has euphoric, uplifting piano melodies being the primary driving
  force like the way Model Man employs. It’s so whole in its delivery, going through different
  genres, tempos, and sampling techniques. It gets more incredible the more you listen and adding
  context to the album makes it more incredible; Capreoli’s father used to be the drummer of the
  band Lovexpress from 1974 to 1979. He was serendipitously handed a batch of cassettes by his
  father of some of the bands live shows from the late 1970s. The cassettes form the basis of, and
  the inspiration for this LP. A must listen!

  title="Speed Oddity vol. III by Toma Kami"
  link="https://tomakami.bandcamp.com/album/speed-oddity-vol-iii"
  standout="‘Blades’"
  embed="album=4145825106"
>
  The Dub Techno producer adds four originals and a remix from Brodinski to his collection. ‘Quad’
  and the remix of it are honestly quite nauseating with the use of terrifying screams but pushing
  past the first track leaves some amazing bangers in ‘Hot Trash’, ‘Blades’, and the Hash Mix of
  ‘Blades’. ‘Blades’ primary driving element is unique in that it is just exhale’s of air panning
  around the sound space with stripped back drum patterns. ‘Hot Trash’ is speedy bass laden with
  stab sounds interjecting through a rolling sound. Toma Kami is in hot demand playing in Paris,
  Lisbon, and a special London party in Ormside Projects last week for the record shop, book shop,
  and radio station, KINDRED, alongside Glimmerman and Ailish.

  title="Aerga Vol. 1 by Ethereal Skies"
  link="https://etherealxxskies.bandcamp.com/album/aerga-vol-01"
  embed="album=1870261986"
>
  A truly special introduction into the label world from Dublin avant-electroniq party Ethereal
  Skies who gather 21 artists from Ireland and afar on this multifaceted V/A, springing up sounds in
  trance, hard-groove, dubstep, hard house & more. You’ll have heard us harping on about this
  release after our premiere of Small Bear’s{" "}

  entry. There are so many more stand out sounds on here including production debuts from HelloKT,
  along with contributions from rising stars like Dylan Fogarty.

  title="Mister Melt by Rhyw"
  link="https://rhyw.bandcamp.com/album/mister-melt"
  standout="Spritz"
  embed="album=287922708"
>
  After gathering steam with his release 'Honey Badger', Rhyw is continuing to show his immense
  creative expertise in bass and techno. Meant for the club. Meant to surprise. Meant to challenge
  you, and it is an exciting direction that Rhyw and similar artists are undertaking. Mister Melt is
  criminally underrated, with four intense squelchy bass tunes.

  title="Cosmosis by Otik"
  link="https://otik.bandcamp.com/album/cosmosis"
  standout="‘Odyssey’"
  embed="album=147928463"
>
  Otik has dominated the niche of dreamy UK Techno as of late, and while this EP receives acclaim
  from music heads, it goes under the radar of the masses. Cosmosis consists of eleven tracks with
  shimmering breakbeats, celestial sounds, and orchestral synths. Otik displays his versatile range
  with stress-reducing melodies in ‘Epiphania’ and ‘Geronimo’, soft-spoken positivity in ‘Non
  Believer’ and ‘Blue Hills’, and time-stopping, atmospheric ambience in ‘God Given’ and
  ‘Noontides’. The liveliest track, ‘Odyssey’, is our favourite. A fast jungle breaks tune with orbs
  hovering above.

  standout="Hablando Conmigo"
>
  Chloé Robinson & DJ ADHD are a constant strong pairing that provide club ready tunes that will
  have you dancing immediately with their recognisable sharp drum sounds. The pumpy, tech house
  tracks find a groove using fast release on the kicks and claps. The duo join on ‘0121 Do One’
  while DJ ADHD goes solo on ‘Hablando Conmigo’, with an additional remix by Coffintexts.

  titleLabel="(Sneaker Social Club)"
  titleLink="https://sneakersocialclub.bandcamp.com"
  standout="Bravery"
  embed="album=3161455819"
>
  Two A-sides and two B-sides from the internationally toured producer and DJ, Neil Landstrumm. The
  Edinburgh resident goes back to basics with Bass ‘n’ Bleeps with nearly thirty years of
  productions behind him. With all that experience, his releases of late become more intuitive to
  produce with heavier and looser rhythms. ‘Set in Plaster’ has some spooky dubs and warbly samples
  ready for any soundsystem.

  title="Glue Kit by Mor Elian"
  link="https://morelian.bandcamp.com/album/glue-kit"
  standout="Eso Eso"
  embed="album=488096359"
>
  Two hard hittaz from Berlin based DJ and producer, and Label owner at "Fever AM". If you like
  metallic techno from the likes of Blawan and LCY, you’ll enjoy this. ‘Eso Eso’ is a bouncy track
  with a sparkly vocal. Likewise, ‘Teke Teke’ has flirtatious energy with tube-like thumps and weird
  ghost notes that add to its distinctive appeal.

  title="Antarctica by BAYANG"

  titleLabel="(tha Bushranger)"

>
  <HoverLink url="https://contentnetau.bandcamp.com/music?from=btl" name="CONTENT.NET.AU" external /> are back on the drops with BAYANG’s limitless ‘Antarctica’ mixtape. Mining punk tones with elegant cloud hip/ hop and hardened lyricism, BAYANG describes the posited world of tha Bushranger, a skinhead with soul. These songs have love. They’ve got fuck-offery. Some of them even got that groove :o  
Really enjoyable steppers including fun link-ups with Sevy, LILPIXIE, & more.

  title="Observe, extract by Elpac"

  titleLabel="(Nostro Hood System)"
  titleLink="https://nostrohoodsystem.bandcamp.com/"
  embed="album=3196177886"
>
  Typically weighty and weird from the Nostro Hood faithful. Bristol’s Elpac takes their turn on the
  imprint with vigour chopping through harsh-groove low ends, thick & jittery percussion, as well as
  an amass of oddball synth lines, sharp intermittent vocals, and mechanical backgrounds. There are
  illusions of dancehall within the track structures that Elpac joyfully manipulates into freakishly
  dense drum runners. You’ll find new trinkets and intricacies with each listen.

  title="Suture // Sneak by Kami-O"
  link="https://kami-o.bandcamp.com/album/suture-sneak"
  standout="Sneak"
  embed="album=2030881777"
>
  Cutting edge dubstep as always from Glasgow’s Kami-O. Suture’s deeply subdued energy calmly
  evolves with deep riding kicks and bass lines creating rippling sensations at its peak. ‘Sneak’ is
  a real bass hummer journeying through the dense wastelands of half-time with its blubbering
  low-ends and crisp drums.

  title="Rebuild by Tension"
  link="https://tensionfi.bandcamp.com/album/rebuild"
  embed="album=61483046"
>
  Alarming drum thumps from one half of the Flood backroom. Cacophonies of Eastern drums and
  splintering bass thrusts pile on as Tension’s crushing breakdowns pave the way for that signature,
  intoxicating tribal flow we now come to expect from the imprint.

  title="From Manchester to Palestine by MCR4PAL"
  link="https://mcr4pal.bandcamp.com/album/from-manchester-to-palestine"
  embed="album=2339784876"
>
  Over 100 Manchester creatives come together to provide aid for the people of Palestine through
  song & poetry. Brought together within a period of 7 days, it highlights the championed compassion
  of the people of Greater Manchester, with stunning tracks offered up from the likes of Mr. Scruff,
  Jack Ward, and INGI.

  titleLabel="(Failed Units)"
  titleLink="https://failedunits.bandcamp.com/"
  embed="album=280169525"
>
  Failed Units return with the Fusion Tank initiative after the rip-roaring success of the DJ
  Pacifier and Folded Voices entry back in December of last year. Stolen Velour & Klahrk do damage
  on this double entry wreaking havoc with one stuttering breakcore thriller in ‘Fight Me’, and one
  clanky 4x4 techno runner in ‘Get Back To Work’, with both intensifying amidst heavy glitch
  breakdowns. It packs a seriously weighty punch for a two track EP.

  embed="album=3569813371"
>
  When he’s not making Tiktoks, Fred Asquith is making techno apparently!? Don’t let his humorous
  side fool you, as he comes out with two interesting peak-time bangers. The respected label,
  Kneaded Pains, gives Fred a platform to showcase his impressive two track stomping productions and
  he takes it.

>
  Glasgow on Glasgow as Drumheller arrives on Hang Tough. Exploring a wealth of atmospheres and
  foundations across 5 hits, Drumheller brings a sharpened groove to the sounds of Jersey, baile
  funk, drill and hard drum, blurring the lines between the genres on tracks like{" "}

  and ‘Leopard’ in particular. J Wax brings a welcomed two-steppin’ electro interpretation of the
  title track into the mix also.

  title="Split Fountain by Plesk Parallel"
  link="https://pleskparallel.bandcamp.com/album/spit-fountain"
  embed="album=3711425922"
>
  Cognitive brain dance from Plesk Parallel on London’s ever-intriguing All Centre. The warped
  journey of title track ‘Split Fountain’ rigorously explores the capabilities of the CR-78 drum
  machine, reverberating with drum clicks and abrasive sub-low kicks across delicate synth melodies.
  ‘Morpho’ channels 90’s & 00’s broken techno, shadowing the scape with stern kicks and more
  intricate synth work. A pretty faultless two tracker this.

  from acts like Jensen Interceptor, Aloka, & Sonia Calico, adding another layer of bite to LVRA’s inimitable
  sound.
