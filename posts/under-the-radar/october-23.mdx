  titleLabel="(Maeve Records)"

>
  Immerse yourself in this hypnotic journey from Jonathan Kasper as he expertly weaves and winds
  through a half hour of deep techno. A Mano Le Tough remix of 'Can't stop' is the cherry on top of
  an already sublime production. Check out the release on the excellent Berlin label Maeve who've
  also premiered New Jackson, The Drifter, and Kev Sheridan in the past.

  title="From the River to the Sea - Various Artists Compilation by Faoi Thalamh Records"
  link="https://faoithalamhrecords.bandcamp.com/album/from-the-river-to-the-sea-various-artists-compilation"
  standout="Ádhamh - COMM£RCIAL R€ADINE$$"
  embed="album=2908653836"
>
  Faoi Thalamh Records' compilation highlights an important cause by gathering together outrageous
  talent that expands into the realms of experimental, electro, techno, and ambience. The first two
  tracks set the tone. A harsh and unforgiving existence. From there we are met with a wall of
  disturbing sounds and impressions that will challenge you. The compilation ends in an
  electro-techno post-apocalyptic wasteland with MEJMI and Ádhamh setting the scene. From the River
  to the Sea, Palestine will be free. Essential listening.

  title="OUT THA POND 001 by Cheek Records"
  link="https://cheekrecords.bandcamp.com/album/out-tha-pond-001"
  embed="album=3770882834"
>
  Supergross curates a fresh compilation of rave-ready tunes via Cheek Records with Volume 1 seeing
  contributions from the west of Ireland and beyond. The name of the label delivers on its promise
  with a selection of playful and fun selections. Tunes like 'Optimus Crime 2' by Dj HÖRDE ft. Dj
  Mischkonsum and 'At Last' by Kolly Borda portray the label's energetic personality while tracks
  like 'Axis' by Obelus and '4pints' by INLNDR show off the solid Techno prowess. One not to miss is
  'Essa' by matchu, a finger-guns ablaze wobbler with infectious energy to spare. Supergross's own
  '444' is a 150bpm effervescent charmer that reflects the way they DJ with big, bold drums and
  uplifting synths. It's all a bit tongue-in-cheek.

  titleLink="https://ycolife.bandcamp.com"
  standout="Planet of the Vapes"
  embed="album=4051479537"
>
  ‘Up And At Them!’ is a powerful opening to a three part EP release. Aya and BFTT kick off with
  spritely floating synths, constantly hinting at a low-end release to come. That release does
  appear with the next tune, ‘Planet of the Vapes’, which has a dizzying flurry of basses and saw
  waves. Great sound design with all elements hitting you at once and that solid selection of sounds
  continues with the final trudgy ‘Beam Me Up Stotty’.

>
  Heavy hitting productions from yet another Bristol resident. Toby Ross uses his influences in
  Jungle, Reggae, and Dub to bring together four outstanding club songs. This project on the highly
  esteemed Shall Not Fade label sees a more rolling 140 sound compared to his previous releases on
  Dnb Allstars, Liondub International, Jungle Cakes, and Deep In The Jungle Records. The youngster
  is flying high and is absolutely one to keep an eye on.

>
  Diessa lands on Turin-based imprint early reflex with an overdue EP travelling through hard drum,
  glitch techno throbs, and leftfield cuts across three sharp club stabs. A first original EP from
  the SZNS7N alumni since 2021 and it's been well worth the wait from our view.

  titleLabel="(Of Paradise)"
  titleLink="https://ofparadise.bandcamp.com"
  embed="album=2499756970"
>
  UK jungle tycoon Thugwidow doesn’t go any way other than full pelt. The ‘Archetypal’ EP on
  London’s ‘Of Paradise’ may be one of his most impressive efforts to date though. Emotive and
  unreserved, Thugwidow crafts blitzing jungle patterns with downtempo backgrounds, using distorted
  song and effects to break down barriers in sound connectivity. It’s quite masterful really.

  embed="album=2288075061"
>
  Hassan Abou Alam’s 2022 release ‘Ice’ gets the Nikki Nair treatment and as always, it's a bit
  mental and a bit magic. A ping-ponging hybrid of footwork and future garage, the Atlanta producer
  flips up what was already a killer track giving it a whole new face with glass punched percussion
  and falling chords en masse.

>
  Valencian duo No Human Sound push the throttle on their dual EP, ‘Liminal’. Probing into deep
  dubstep and bass territories, the pair thrive in glitch situations almost in act to mask how thick
  their sound could go. Extremely well crafted tracks that are sure to raise some eyebrows in the
  club.
