  The final installment in Philadelphian DJ Delish’s Khadijah series paying homage to all things

  shares 6 tracks that capture the true essence of ballroom; the energy, the passion, the
  competition, the community and the coolness.

>
  DJ Smokey returns in true nuked out fashion with the blockbuster Dance Party mixtape. A typically
  not so serious approach from the Canadian who once again delivers murky yet danceable Memphis rap
  cuts with sides of drill, grime and bass. It’s NUKE RADIO!

>
  Sloucho continues to go from strength after last month’s ‘MEMORY WALK’ single with another bomb
  track in ‘TM’D my DM’S’. With a razor sharp bass foundation hummerring below, the Irish act finds
  the right fizz with clinking drums and pitched vocals with a ferocious energy.

  PLUR (Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect) is an ethos that many ravers try to follow and it is now
  Canadian-born producer Ryan James Ford's new label. He tries to embody the code behind PLUR with
  his Ripping EP with some immense kicks paired with cute and sparkly synths. The movement started
  in the US and shows a more colourful rave scene than to what is experienced in Berlin, where Ford
  currently resides but it is picking up steam.

  titleLabel="(A Long Strange Dream)"
  titleLink="batutimedance.bandcamp.com"

>
  Batu commands your attention with this yo-yo of ambient tranquil sounds and heavy dancefloor
  igniters on his new label. For Spirits start off dreamy and introspective with ‘Traverse’, lifts
  the energy high with ‘In Tongues’, falls right back down to serene levels with ‘Foraged In The
  Margins’, then bursts with a glitchy intensity in ‘For Spirits’ before concluding with a state of
  calm in ‘Through The Glass’. The alternating high-and-low energy will absolutely leave you craving
  for more.

  title="Set The Roof by Hudson Mohawke & Nikki Nair"

  titleLink="hudsonmohawke.bandcamp.com"
  standout="‘More Recently’"
  embed="album=1582631075"
>
  Huge link-up between two artists on top right now, Mohawke & Nair come together to create three
  bangers. Two feel-good rave tunes ‘Set The Roof’ and ‘Demurro’, and a tune that shouldn’t work,
  ‘More Recently’, when it’s deconstructed. With its Alvin & The Chipmunks sounds and out of the
  norm samples, it's quite the stomper.

  title="Dream Machine by Pressa X Drumskull"
  link="https://drumskull.bandcamp.com/album/dream-machine"
  titleLink="drumskull.bandcamp.com"
  standout="‘Dream Machine (Original Mix)’"
  embed="album=3873869012"
>
  ‘Dream Machine’ has got groovy basslines, cowbells, an inviting chorus melody, and three remixes
  from Settle Down, Borai, and Drumskull himself. Each interpretation has irresistible breaks and
  high-octane energy but the original’s luscious pads are hard to skip.

  titleLink="jexopolis.bandcamp.com"
  standout="‘Pneumatic’"
  embed="album=4003722435"
>
  Jex Opolis comes through once again with vigorous upbeat tunes. Nostalgic for the 90’s House
  dancers, this release gels together different bits of acid, progressive house, Moog basslines.

  standout="Never Going Home (Ciel's Homesick Bounce)"
  embed="album=190285653"
>
  Fantastical shimmering sounds from CFCF remixers. ‘Ciel's Homesick Bounce’ is a euphoria-dumping
  ride from start to finish. Each remix is given dutiful attention and care to give that
  retrospective feeling that the original had when it was first recorded 2018.

  standout="‘World’s End’"
  embed="album=3182724856"
>
  Alien planet rhythms from Jossy Mitsu as sounds reflect and bounce around this six track EP. Mitsu
  has created an illusion of distance and space using reverbs and delay FX. A deep, dark dive into
  the underbelly of subby electronic music!

  titleLink="tomeverett.bandcamp.com"
  embed="album=4291725156"
>
  Another easy breezy effort from Tom Everett. In August 2020, he released his standout track
  ‘Patti’ that amassed over 1.3 million plays on Spotify. ‘Tell Me What You're Wanting’ is a more
  emotion-driven effort that is just as dancey as ever.
