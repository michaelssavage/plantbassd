  title="Thank God We Have Metavers by Malaise Vagal"
  link="https://malaisevagal.bandcamp.com/album/thank-god-we-have-metavers"
  embed="album=1426684054"
>
  The Parisian artist releases a <strong>‘Name Your Price’</strong> EP of experimentation sounds and
  unkind world building. RATP is a track with distinct sections starting off at a reserved dub pace
  with trap hi hats, before heading into a Reggaeton beat with more upbeat bass stabs. Malaise Vagal
  provides vocals on ‘Abolir Les Frontières’ which begins with wide pads and headroom for acid
  sounds before narrowing into a pacey techno finish. ‘Thank God We Have Metavers’ closes out the EP
  off with a push in tempo, priming itself as a percussive club weapon. An interesting project
  that’s well worth a listen.

  title="Nasty Tales Vol​.​3 [NE010] by Nasty Enterprises"
  link="https://nastyenterprises.bandcamp.com/album/nasty-tales-vol-3-ne010"
  standout="808bhz - huehueBR"
  embed="album=1585361056"
>
  Twenty big attitude tracks to play at the clurrbb, this is a compilation with no weaknesses, with
  a plethora of remixes & edits coming from all over the globe including Dublin hell-raiser Roo
  Honeychild. There are no set genres with the producers being relied on to bring the heat in their
  desired format. ‘huehueBR’ by 808bhz opens up the playing field with a baile banger, while
  LuBeat’s ‘Free Biz’ and Aleroj’s ‘Floral Shoppe Uwuaracha’ supply optimistic bangs in the 160
  range.

  title="Timeless Class​​​-​​​X Vol​​​.​​​2 by KETA CAVIAR"
  link="https://resonancemoscow.bandcamp.com/album/timeless-class-x-vol-2"
  titleLabel="(Resonance Moscow)"
  titleLink="https://resonancemoscow.bandcamp.com"
  standout="Dollar, Pound, Peso, Yen, Rupee"
  embed="album=2890804502"
>
  A trio of vicious wild-running dunts from KETA CAVIAR on Timeless Class-X Vol.2, these tracks
  wouldn't be out of place in a Locked Club release of yesteryears. The EP initiates with luscious
  thumpy kicks and textured percussion in ‘Dollar, Pound, Peso, Yen, Rupee’ before being hit with a
  melee of sirens and white noise. There’s an interesting use of flanger on the percussion which
  changes its dynamics over time, adding an extra layer of panic to the track. The same goes for
  ‘Cemetery of ideas’ which aggravates with a gross metallic kick and an arpeggiator that works its
  way into your brain. ‘Dummy sex’ cements this theme with its tight over-configured loops and
  roaring kicks.

  title="Nechung by Siu Mata & Amor Satyr"
  link="https://wajang.bandcamp.com/album/nechung-2"
  titleLabel="(WAJANG)"
  titleLink="https://wajang.bandcamp.com"
  standout="Oracle"
  embed="album=1474307621"
>
  Dark tribal action as WAJANG returns with the deadly, sickening duo of Siu Mata & previous Plant
  Bass’d guest Amor Satyr. Three tracks of subby sounds rolling at the magic bpm of 140. ‘Oracle’
  may be the strongest track on the EP making use of a persistent and invasive low-frequency
  humming/ droning noise. Nordic folklore, ‘The Hum’, comes to mind when hearing this. They're
  getting silly with this release.

  title="Jabbaphlex EP by Fiesta Soundsystem"
  link="https://fiestasoundsystem.bandcamp.com/album/jabbaphlex-ep"
  standout="Trifling Triffid"
  embed="album=2762199894"
>
  Another <strong>‘Name Your Price’</strong> EP and this one is chaotic. The first track,
  “Jabbaphlex”, opens up with a demented voice saying “Beware the jub jub bird, The jaws that bite,
  the claws that catch!”, a line from the dark and creepy poem Jabberwocky. A sort of forewarning of
  the impending dark and monstrous sounds come. ‘Trifling Triffid’ is brazen in its breaks and subby
  808s, whilst ‘Fata Morgana’ delves more into auditory illusion with thunder noises that rise from
  technical automations, before the glitchbreak finale of ‘Frumweorc Vortex’ induces with its series
  of unpredictable deconstructing sounds.

  titleLabel="(Ovelha Trax)"
  titleLink="https://ovelhatrax.bandcamp.com"
  standout="DJ Botermelk - Treat Me"
  embed="album=3724079315"
>
  Electro badness from DJ Botermelk & Kover in this 7 track EP. Taking influence from the Rave
  Generator plugin, the duo have produced some busy cosmic bangers with ghetto & acid elements
  throughout.

  title="Bridge Street by HU-SANE (self-released)"
  link="https://hu-sane.bandcamp.com/track/bridge-street"
  embed="track=2811905125"
>
  Few debut releases come as solid as this Bhangra inspired garage whacker from Glasgow’s HU-SANE.
  Aggravated bass lines, thick kicks and delightfully fluid bhangra percussion turn this one into a
  true basement delight.

  title="It’s Pulling My Strings by Async Figure"
  link="https://asyncfigure.bandcamp.com/album/it-s-pulling-my-strings"
  titleLabel="(Sea Cucumber)"
  titleLink="https://seacucumberinfo.bandcamp.com/"
  embed="album=2715948407"
>
  After teasing us all back in April with a mini-mix of unknown quantities on ‘Back To The Pit’,
  Async Figure unleashed their most telling work to date with ‘It’s Pulling My Strings’ in September
  on Shanghai’s Sea Cucumber. You’ll go some way to find an electronic release as epic as this in
  2023. Striking bass music filled with anthemic synth proportions, hypnotic vocal samples, and the
  duo’s growingly signature percussive nuances.

  title="Saor EP by Lúnasa (self-released)"
  link="https://lunasa-wav.bandcamp.com/album/saor-ep"
  embed="album=1930826988"
>
  Devilish drums from Dublin's Lúnasa who debuts with the two track whack of ‘Saor’. Sprinkling together elements of speed dembow, hard drum and bass, Lúnasa creates two primal club tracks soaked with mutating energies from sensual vocals, forward-thinking melodies and even repurposed sound bites from a jaw harp. What a way to announce yourself into the production world!

  Even the Strong founder NKC delivers yet again this calendar year with the riveting ‘Menace’ EP.
  As always, the Bristolian’s primitive drum energy shines through, this time manoeuvring through a

  title="Perfect Health VA by Magdalena's Apathy"
  link="https://magdalenasapathy.bandcamp.com/album/perfect-health-m-a031"
  embed="album=3105310552"
>
  Greek label Magdalena’s Apathy have treasured us with some of the more advanced dark hard dance
  releases in recent years, and so, their VA releases always heighten our attention. ‘Perfect
  Health’ marks the third VA to come from the imprint and features 13 tentative hi-speed dance trax
  embracing hard trance, techno, and psy from DJ Ibon, Huong Federkeil, Disto, and more.

  titleLabel="(Dill Dodos Recife)"
  titleLink="https://dilldodosrecife.bandcamp.com"
  embed="album=2709309696"
>
  An otherworldly exploration through bass palettes from French producer Dites Safran on Dill Dodos
  Recife. ‘Tuning Boa’ takes inspiration from the relentless upheaval of city rush hours,
  transmitting through urban soundscapes and describing those energies in sound. It’s not a million
  miles away from the club sphere either with pummelling bass lines, glitching melodies and sonic
  synth works a plenty.

>
  Minimal UK Techno and wicked leftfield sounds coming out of Freiburg from TX4 on Laye Audio. Four
  wobbly tracks that rummage through liquid bass functions, sonic hand drums, and groaning synth
  progressions, modded elegantly towards darker club situations.

  link="https://vyperor.bandcamp.com/track/hatsune-polkka"
  embed="track=21844921"
>
  Inexplicable speed from Brooklyn rave star vyper. A minimalist maximalist hard style drum chaser
  from the future zone, this one goes crazy with its acidic squeals and hyper bard melodies.
  Fast-paced fun for all!

  embed="album=3881858034"
>
  Machine Woman transcends through unravelling glitched out techno across 5 transmissions on Delsin.
  Each track finds itself in a constant state of mutation yet never veering too far away from their
  premise, maintaining configured grooves throughout.
