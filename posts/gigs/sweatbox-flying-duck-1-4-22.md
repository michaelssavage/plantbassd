### Our next Glasgow SweatBox is ready for Martyn Bootyspoon at the Flying Duck Club with support from H3L3NA, Sweet Philly and OISIÃÅN!

We return with our next SweatBox party to the Flying Duck with Canadian hot house afficionado Martyn Bootyspoon! Stopping by as part of his UK/EU Silk Tour.

A sound spanning electro, hot house, raunchy club music, techno, & beyond, Bootyspoon has become synonymous in dance music circles for his pumped up booty shaking, ghetto tech and Chicago inspired sound.
A perfect match for the hate defying and freedom inspiring SweatBox sound!

Support on the night comes Glasgow electro head H3L3NA (Clyde Built), Dublin's trance and US club experimentalist Sweet Philly, and Plant Bass'd's own OISIN (EHFM). üåê
