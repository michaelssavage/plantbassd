### SWEATBOX X STEREO PRESENT: Clara!

Stereo is joining forces with basement favourites Sweatbox to bring Spanish-born, Brussels-based MC and DJ Clara! to Glasgow on Saturday 18th November.

Clara‚Äôs unique, bass heavy and undeniably banging approach to Reggaeton production has led to collaborations with Pearson Sound and Low Jack, having gained a following for her ‚ÄúReggaetoneras‚Äù mixtape series released on the latter‚Äôs Editions Gravats label. With her upcoming release on AD93 ‚ÄúPulso‚Äù, she continues to bend and mutate the genre into new and unexplored territories.

Support comes from esteemed local selector DJ Maicol along with Glasgow party-starters Chicha and Loreto.
