### SweatBox meets Miami bass specialists INVT at the headquarters of heat itself, Sneaky Pete‚Äôs ü§ù.

Masters of bass, the INVT two bring a signature groove to the club foundations of UKG, techno, dubstep, & jungle with their signature drum arrangements and reverberating low ends, pushed forward by their Latin influences of baile, dembow, reggaeton and cumbia. It‚Äôs a surefire frenzy of noise thats fit for intimate club situations, carnival street parties and raucous festival energies alike. Luca and Dalbert are taking it all around the world.

A Scottish debut for this Miami inferno, we‚Äôre truly pleasured to bring this together for you with support from two of Ireland‚Äôs bass kings in Flood label runner Doubt alongside Wriggle Dublin‚Äôs Vionel Messi and our own oBrother who go back to back to back from 11-1 !

As always SweatBox is a space and place for all the dancers. We operate gender neutral toilets, dance floor monitoring and the swift removal of any persons making the vibes uncomfortable for anyone else.
