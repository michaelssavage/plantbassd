£5 Tax -> £7 OTD.

Shadesy //
One of the brains behind the infamous Das Booty label / party / collective. AKA Butt Rogers. AKA Greggery Peccary. A supplier of some of the freakiest tunes on the internet, Shadesy's been at the heart of it for time. Fronting some of London's maddest parties at Venue MOT, he's been bringing together acts like Jerome Hill, Big Dope P, and We Rob Rave down south as well as platforming some of the hardest productions you're likely to find anywhere on the co-inciding label. Fear-E, Bad Boombox, & Polo Lilli have all featured since 2020.

DJ Bastard //
Returning back to his motherland for this one, the Hyperdome boss has been another solid contributor to the rougher edges of clubland in the last few years with a deft ability to create slappers in electro, ghetto tech, footwork, latintek, & more. You'll find at least one of his tunes on any decent USB. Also a consistent figure at Das Booty parties, we expect some solid dual energy alongside Mr. Shades.

DV60 //
Edinburgh's hard techno solution. Jonesy doesn't do slow. Proper rapid techno productions that have come out the other end in sets from Franck, Charlie Sparks & more. He's about ready to blow up any day now!

Lara Sinclair //
What a surge its been in the last year for Lara. You'll find her on at least one line-up every week up and doon the Cowgate. Garage, speed-garage, bass, grime, and everything else. You can expect all that kinda nonsense from the newest member of the Volens Chorus! B2B with DV60. HOT.
