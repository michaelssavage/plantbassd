### Back to Sneaky’s for our next Heaters show with Dundee electro mammoth @ytp.aiff on the 9th of March!

After an epic show with TAAHLIAH last week we are ready to go again with Heaters for a night of electro and ghetto tech hard trax with a man who has graced labels like @bemorechildish, @international_chrome\_ , & @urban.rar to name but a few.

Support from Ten Pence Criminal (Das Booty Records) & our own OISÍN on the night.

Hate defying and freedom inspiring hard trax all night long!
