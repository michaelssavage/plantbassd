## Plant Bass'd return home for their first show on Irish soil with an ensemble featuring some of the most exciting electronic talent on the Isle in the notorious Wigwam basement.

After establishing a series of hot 'n sleazy SweatBox shows in Edinburgh and Glasgow featuring guests like TAAHLIAH, Roo Honeychild, and Martyn Bootyspoon, the focus turns to home as we showcase some of the most relishing experimental dance talents to come out of the country in some time.

Crumb resident ayolxi introduces herself to the Plant Bass'd sphere after grabbing our attention with her adept mixing style that crosses techno, footwork, electro and more. This style has seen her share bills with acts like 999999999 and Julian Muller as of late.
Facing off in a teeth gritting b2b, ayolxi will be sharing the Wigwam controls with local dub master, Glimmerman. Shining after an impressive release on First Second label in 2021, Glimmerman's potent deliverance of all things bass has gained him consistent access to the Dublin circuit as well as recent shows in London.

Closing out affairs, Thrust collective colleagues Rory Sweeney and sohotsospicy will finish off proceedings with a set that is sure to test the Wigwam sound barrier. Two glistening producers that can muster up anything from US club, to footwork, to grime, or jungle, leaving us dumbfounded as to what we should expect to hear from the pair. We like the sound of it a lot!

Plant Bass'd residents OIS√çN, Michael Average, and Peter Toal will be opening the Bank Holiday sizzle on the night. Expect all things clubby, weird, dark, and wonderful!
