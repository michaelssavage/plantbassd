### Plant Bass'd return with their SweatBox series to Stereo Club with Hamburg ghetto tech and electro stalwart DJ MELL G

The founder of the Juicy Gang imprint, Mell's stock has risen greatly over the last few years working with labels like childsplay, International Chrome, as well as collaborating with DJ FuckOff, DJ Godfather, Karnage Kills, & more on her own productions.

Local support comes from Nyla (VANDAL / Jerry Horny) alongside KOPI O (Power Pot) who are set to initiate a torrid night of electro, ghetto tech, booty bass and hard dance at the Renfield Lane venue.

VNC.PTK also joins us for a breathtaking VJ performance with visuals amassing chromatic, cyborg layers fit to match the futuristic bass of Mell G and co. (!!!)
