### Bok Bok, cofounder of legendary label Night Slugs, returns to the capital. An unmissable night for UK dance music heads.

Back in the club with Night Slugs founder and UK bass legend Bok Bok!

Having had an integral role to play in the transformation of UK club music over the past two decades, Bok Bok has become famed for his subtle crossovers into grime, hip-hop, house, hard-drum, funky & beyond.

The honour is Plant Bass’d’s to be bringing Bok back to the Scottish capital once more with support coming from promising central belters ELANDA (Clyde Built), Daksh (EMS) and our own oBrother.

All out drum pumps from open to close!
