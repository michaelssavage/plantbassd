### Plant Bass'd return with their locally sourced Organica series, this time to new surroundings in the Grand Social

Focusing on locally sourced acts, Organica aims to gather together some of the most promising artists and spinners in the surrounding areas with inclusive and diverse lineups spanning through hip hop, grime, garage, breaks, UK & US club, techno, jungle, electro & beyond!

After a successful launch night with E the Artist, Jenn Hession, Silky Klub, and Sweet Philly at Cellar Club, this time around we are inviting scene-bustin' vocalist Curtisy along for the ride with selections from D\*mp, Lychee and HelloKT alongside the Bass'd residents. This is a night for everyone as such is the ethos of Plant Bass'd. A club night for the people. Come out and support your local scene, Let's make it happen!

Tickets 5euros no matter what! No one turned away for lack of funds :)
