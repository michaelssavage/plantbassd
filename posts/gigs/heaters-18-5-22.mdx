### Back at the Sneaky Pete's club for another night of insatiable hot trax in the next edition of our SweatBox series 💦

After recent heated shows with TAAHLIAH, Martyn Bootyspoon, and Roo Honeychild, this feature sees 3 of the hottest spinners on the Central Belt take on the testing temperatures of Sneaky Pete's.

Glasgow's Sarra Wild (OH141) and Miss Cabbage (Fast Muzik) headline an impressive bill further bolstered by Revolt party starter DJ Petfood, and our own OISÍN (EHFM).

Sarra Wild's eclectic mixing of genres like ballroom, r&b, and Lebanese pop, combine to create sensual club feels that garner intimate interactions with crowds everywhere they go. Described by FACT Magazine as 'one of Glasgow's most vital DJs', their groundbreaking sound has given them access to crowds across multiple continents as well as regular appearances on Rinse France and NTS Radio.

Arising out of Glasgow's formidable fast club scene, Miss Cabbage's robust sound amasses trance, hyperpop, hardcore, and all things hot and fiery. A regular feature at Glasgow's Fast Muzik and Ministry Of Pound parties, Miss Cabbage has been on our radar for some time and is well equipped to take on the SweatBox steam!

DJ Petfood is synonymous with the creative bending Revolt parties that have graced Summerhall in recent months. Combining art installations and raw club sounds, Petfood's mixing texture of US club, ballroom, and hot house falls in seamlessly to this Heaters bill.

This is a party for everyone. Leave your dress codes at home and immerse in a night of hate defying and freedom inspiring hard trax!

£5 no matter what!
