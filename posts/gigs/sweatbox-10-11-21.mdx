### We are back with another SweatBox party! This time across the road to @bongoclub.edinburgh.

Another Irish infiltration is in store as Dublin fast house don and @peardublin affiliate Fio Fa headlines the main room with support from Feena (@missworldedinburgh) and OISIÃÅN (@plantbassdworld).

Edinburgh female and LGBTQ+ party series Mind The Gap takes over duties upstairs on the night with a curation of local talent.

Again, this is a night for us all. A letter for everyone. Forget your worries and leave your dress code at home. Embrace yourself in the sweat and hard riddimz!

Electro/ Garage/ Ghetto Tech/ Hard House/ Breaks/ Trance sounds all night long.

Entry ¬£5. Link to tickets: <HoverLink url="ra.co/events/1480079" external /> üëπ

@okcoolgraphics on the graphics front once more!
