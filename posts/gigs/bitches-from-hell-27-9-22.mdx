### Bringing mystical hard traxxx on the 27th October

HELL IS A PLACE ON EARTH But sometimes our devilz can be little sweetiez too?!

The Gang Of Bitches From Hell show off their mystical side as they return to Bongo Club for a fairy-fuelled hard dance rave after a fearsome first outing with Joey Mousepads, Miss Cabbage and Melly.

This time the winged angels PooG1rl (Bloodsport), KateLate, and Mackerel Sky (EHFM) join Lucky Dip for an evening of turbo dance trax right in the heart of Spooky Season xxx

Please arrive dressed in FairyCore xxx

HARDCORE // TRANCE // TECHNO // HYPERPOP // GHETTO TECH & MORE XXX
