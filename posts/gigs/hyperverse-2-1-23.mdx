### Plant Bass'd takes SweatBox into the Hyperverse dimension

We are back in our club hub of Sneaky Pete's for one night of all out hyperpop, gabber, ethereal trance & hard dance fusions.

We're flipping the club upside down and inside out with guest sets from Glasgow and Edinburgh in ELFZ, Danyo, and SeaUrchin, as well as an exciting feature from Dublin's Skin & Blister regular MIA!
