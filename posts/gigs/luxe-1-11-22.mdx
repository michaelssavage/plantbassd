### Plant Bass'd return to Sneaky's with their SweatBox party this time hosting London-based thrill pusher LUXE.

Pressing a hard-hitting electro & bass-driven sound, LUXE has been carving out a position within the UK scene over the last number of years with releases on established imprints like Dansu Discs, HAAI's Radical New Theory label, as well as a forthcoming release on D. Tiffany's esteemed Planet Euphorique.

LUXE's seamless blend into sounds like dubstep, breaks & beyond has allowed her to occupy slots on various lineups appearing on bills across the UK & Europe alongside acts like Sansibar, Yushh, Angel D'Lite & more as of late.

EHFM and Epika resident Naafi joins the support with her dreamy take on club sounds set to cushion the night into shape alongside Plant Bass'd boss O brother.
