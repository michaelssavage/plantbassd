### Plant Bass'd return for the next edition of SweatBox, this time inviting Dublin hardcore contingent Bitten Twice to the capital for a UK debut!

Rory Sweeney and Julia Louise KnifeFist arrive representing the collective bringing their terror-fuelled sounds of jungle, hardcore, gabber, & all things dark, twisted, and fantysical. Fresh off of rip-roaring sets at Ireland's AVA & Open Ear festivals, as well as performances with Machine Girl, the crew are now thirsty for their first taste of Scottish blood.
Sweeney's mesmeric production range and mixing style combined with KnifeFist's gut-punching vocals are set to open up a whole new world to the Sneaky's faithful. It shan't be missed!

Â£5 all night long - <HoverLink url="ra.co/events/1546542" external inline /> - expect Hardcore/ Gabber/ Jungle/ Hard Drum/ US Club/ Electro/ Baile Funk
