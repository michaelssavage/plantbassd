Plant Bass'd presents Organica landed on √Åras Na nGael on Saturday 7th October 2023. 8 DJs spanning multiple genres came together in the cultural hub of Galway for a fun and groovy night. Check out the images below from the talented <HoverLink url="https://www.instagram.com/cathalodalaighceallaigh/" name="@cathalodalaighceallaigh" external /> and <HoverLink url="https://www.instagram.com/thegalwayhook.her/" name="@thegalwayhook.her" external />

Starting the night off we had our own Peter Toal, with his first ever Plant Bass'd appearance, play b2b with the incredible Airy Fairy. The pair worked on getting the first dancers to the floor with Airy Fairy blowing us away with 150bpm stompers. We can't wait to see Airy Fairy take off in the future with her confident mixing skills. Afterwards, Lushed and Michael Average went next with groovin' 130bpm++ of electronica and bass. You can catch a partial recording of their set below but unfortunately the other AMAZING sets had corrupted recordings. üò¢

Danu and Fatalist jumped on at 10.30pm with a perfect pairing of bassy goodness raising the heat again.
A ferocious hour of footwork and jungle bitz that got the room filled. The night was brought to a close
by the phenomenal Supergross and MEJMI. Completely blowing us away with their professionalism and faultlessness,
the pair belted out dark and rolling techno the right way!! Exact, slick, and smart.
