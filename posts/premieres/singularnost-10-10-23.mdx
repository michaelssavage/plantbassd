Noizy Wilson is joined by Tokyo-based act Singularnost on the former's own NÃ¼ Kvlture imprint for the combo strike of Allied Assault VI. The pair tip their hats to the sounds of UK past across three trax of garage, break-beats and bassline, alongside a vocal mix of 'Clean Up' to boot.

Our featured premiere of Singularnost's solo effort on 'Will You' can be best described as a summer-tinged, feel good UKG groover. It's straight to the point. Pacing with a steady two step shuffle & sharp hats with a coating of warm pop vocals, it's a number that's destined for the club.

NÃ¼ Kvlture is a dedicated name-your-price Bandcamp institution and has been providing some of the best accessible underground music into the world for the best part of 2 years now.

From Tokyo via Serbia, with love x
