We're delighted to share Bristol based DROMEK's 'Mistura De Bossa'. His repeated knack for chopping up and subsequently ruining breakbeats finds itself in the form of an 8 minute Skalpel style jazz odyssey, by way of several seminal samba and bossa nova samples and a spicy sprinkle of self-referential sweaty rave culture.
