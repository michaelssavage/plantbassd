Rennes artist Midnight Totem lands on buzzing French label Tripalium Corp with 'Race To Live'. 9 tracks of deep, darkly lit bass and percussive instrumentals resonating with elements of trance, trip-hop and lo-fi.

After battling illness throughout much of her youth, Midnight Totem delves into her feelings of urgency to live on this project. Our featured track 'Denial' finds its course through trembling bass murmurs and monstrous backgrounds that create feelings of tension and desire with provocative trance synth work.
