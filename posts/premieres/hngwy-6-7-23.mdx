Glasgow bass merchants Hang Tough bring forth their second release of the year, 'Flee', from fellow citizen Hngwy.
A choppy transmission of low end bass situations that journey through big room techno, electro-tek, half-time and atmospheric breakbeat.

Our featured premiere 'Ticking' churns on a staggered bass line thrown forward by humming kicks and clicking, side-stepping percussion. Half-time heaven that goes deep whilst maintaining a solid groove throughout.

The Flee EP drops in full just in time for tomorrow's July Bandcamp Friday.
