UK bass and 140 specialist @sdlruk’s forthcoming ‘RUDEBOI’ single is given a touch up of heavy proportions within its coinciding remix pack featuring jungle, dubstep, and grime reworkings.

Coventry based @jamzigg creates a dense and rugged dubstep pallet with thundering low ends that merged alongside intermittent jungle breakdowns, giving ‘RUDEBOI’ a monstrous soundsystem-ready reimagining ⚙️
