Australian label Different Intel inaugurates with its first release from Bristol producer LO CHI on the relentless shapeshifting 'Half Cut' EP. 4 tracks of ebbing and flowing electro, deep hot house, and bass chugs, its a release that's difficult to categorise but easy to f\*ck with.

Our featured premiere, 'Throwing Elbows', does just that with its alluring ticking hats and robust kicks that build towards a solemn electro-fied breakdown of glitch techno, rotating in a solidified 4x4 field.

The EP drops in full on September 1st, right on time for Bandcamp Friday.
