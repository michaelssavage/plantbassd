Glasgow collective Hang Tough return to label action with the bass killer 'Box Cutta' EP from city dynamo Drumheller, with a strong remixing effort from J Wax to boot.

Blurring the lines between drill, baile funk, reggaeton, jersey & more, Drumheller creates bass heavy textures with a focus on body rhythmic grooves throughout his 5 productions on the release.

Our featured premiere 'Serotona' fuses together baile funk and drill, taking inspiration from the dominant Latin sound to create a sensual, hot club energy fuelled on by throbbing bass arrangements.

The EP lands in full on November 24th here: <HoverLink url="hangtough.bandcamp.com/album/box-cutta" external /> ðŸŒ±

Its a proper cracker. Enjoy!
