London singer-songwriter @\_costi_0 debuts on @tt_label with â€˜As above, so belowâ€™. 6 tracks of raw guitar and instrumental focused sound cemented blissfully by the artistâ€™s dark, moody lyricism.

â€˜Walk down a dark path (youâ€™re gonna trip)â€™ cuts its teeth with a grimacing guitar riff alongside c0stiâ€™s angelic yet somewhat devilish voice trickling above with a robust tribal drum beat to fall back on.

Drawing inspiration from the likes of Kurt Cobain and William Blake, alongside the study of dark, light, heaven & hell, cOsti creates a transmission that feels as obsessive as it does liberating.

The EP arrives in full on May 12th via <HoverLink url="www.instagram.com/tt_label/" name="@tt_label" external inline />.
