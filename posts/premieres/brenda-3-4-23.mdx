<hr />

We are back with another premiere from Colombian imprint MUAKK who return with the forthcoming 'SOBESO' compilation, mining together the Latin Core sounds of latin-tek, uwuaracha, latin trance, guaracha, bala and more. A fusion of traditional LATAM rhythms at accelerated hardcore speeds by regional artists all growing towards the international stage.

Our featured premiere 'SUPERVIOLET ROMANCE' by BogotÃ¡ based producer BRENDA rips up a certain Lady Gaga track with raucous energy across a pulsating bala beat with some aggressive MCing!

The compilation drops in full on May 5th here: <HoverLink url="muakk.bandcamp.com/album/sobeso" inline external /> on Bandcamp ðŸŒ±
