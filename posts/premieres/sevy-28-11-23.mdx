London's Tobago Tracks invite the budding South Western Sydney based Sevy on to the imprint with the flourescent 'Merry Go Creek' EP.

The release captures 6 tracks delving into themes of self-affirmation, grappling with authenticity in a world of judgment, surveillance and scarcity of time.

Laid over a mixed bag of blended beats, including bouncy dancehall, Naarm inspired rnb & soul, puluggbn, digicore, kwaito, amapiano & more, the multifaceted Zambian/ Malawian artist exudes a desirable balance of harmony, grit, and rhythmic bounce within each production.

'War We I Know Why' is a deft transmission through the R&B and soul landscapes of naarm crossing over into <HoverLink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugg_music" name="pluggnb" external />. Mining through warm 808 and string layers, Sevy's consuming elysian vocals sink into this instrumental cushioning as he describes the contradictions of surveillance life in 'liberal' Australia.

A deeply thoughtful piece of work from an artist breaking new ground, applying their own specific and indefinable lens to music.

'Merry Go Creek' drops in full on December 12th here: <HoverLink url="tobagotracks.bandcamp.com/album/merry-go-creek" external /> ðŸŒ±
