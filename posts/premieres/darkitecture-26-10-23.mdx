Tripalium Corp's Fucked-Up Squad returns for its second instalment. Nasty club trax from global producers including Intruder.wav, Gartex and Dogputer. Think breakcore, gabber, hard acid, hard tek, & more.

Our featured premiere comes from darkitecture with their explosive techno chaser 'NARCISSUS'. Layered in stocky rhythms that cleverly weave in and out of half-time and 4x4, the track propels with its revolving synth lines, string sequences and organic drums.

'Fucked-Up Squad Vol. 2' arrives in full on November 10th here: <HoverLink url="tripalium.bandcamp.com/album/tmf-04-â€¦p-squad-vol-2" external /> ðŸŒ±
