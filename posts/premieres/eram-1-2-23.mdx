<hr />

Brazilian force ERAM continues her onslaught of fast-paced 2 steppers and hard dance cuts with her forthcoming 'Flop Secrets' EP arriving on the Nice & Deadly imprint.

'Feet Up Tech' is a footwork rave hybrid that paces explicitly alongside some familiar 90s sounds, 808 rhythms and dubbed down vocals. Take it straight to the club, its a smacker!
