Dublin label Harmless Records launch new compilation â€˜Bamboozle Zoneâ€™ featuring 18 global artists spanning an array of enchanted club focused sounds.

Our featured premiere comes from Istanbul artist Overkissed. Titled â€˜Yâ€™, the track emerges from a euro trance palette that eventually merges with a locked & stocked 2 step groove and uplifting synth arps making for a gripping peak time floor filler.

The compilation arrives in full this Friday the 19th via Bandcamp.
