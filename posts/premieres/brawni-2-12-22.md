Brawni drops the third release from his Golden Dawn EP courtesy of Cabal with the shifting electro of 'I Do My Own Stunts'.

Accompanied by a hilarious self-directed video shot on a beach in Dingle which was Inspired by Bruce Lee and kung-fu movies and intended to be 'as over the top as possible'. It gives the track a delighting light-hearted interpretation amidst Brawni's club ready heavy distortion and twisting drum patterns.
