Featured track 'Rave Auld Times' was made using dialogue samples from the renowned 2016 documentary 'Notes On Rave In Dublin' and encompasses the energy of the 90s dance boom in Ireland with a fitting raw and rhythmic breakbeat basement track.

Dublin Delight releases in full on April 6th featuring splendid artwork from DJ Egg.
