Friends of Plant Bass’d, @failed_units kick off their new Fusion Tank collaborative series with Montreal’s DJ Pacifier and New Yorker Folded Voices who deliver on a split EP working one original and one rework of each other respectively.

DJ Pacifier’s ‘Prograsm’ journeys into the glitched out techno and breakcore patterns that the Canadian has become synonymous with. Recent plaudits have seen them feature on the Boiler Room Hard Dance Mix series as well as taking on a recent tour around Europe and the UK with the Failed Units imprint 🌐
