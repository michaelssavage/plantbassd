Noisy Wilzon's NÃœ KVLTURE returns for the fourth year running with its name-your-price V/A series, offering up a selection of multi-faceted electronic sounds from around the world.

Our featured premiere comes from Polish multi-instrumentalist Musley who breaks ground with the atmoshperic breakbeat epic, 'Sunset Showdown'.

Mirroring the energies of early Four Tet and Boards of Canada numbers, Musley creates his template with a symphony of scratchy guitar sounds, serene basslines, and deep, echoing half-time breakbeats. Vast in sound, and meaningful in its temper, the track exudes the dual tensions of expiration and new life. Quite fitting for this current time of year we think.

Our first premiere of the New Year and we hope its another good one for you all! Enjoy!
