New Irish techno label Circuit Structure debuts with a 12 track V/A feature inviting together a host of Ireland's most respected techno producers together on Mullingar native Offtrack's new daring project.

Featured is Stephen Mahoney's 'Switch' which melds a pulsating kick and bass line underneath a groove ridden key melody and further vibrating backgrounds. A real peak-time driver that lies amongst fine company on a release featuring hitters like Billy Spike Island, Jon Hussey, & more.

The V/A is released in full on December 9th (9/12/22).
