Irish hot-house and sex club master Sweet Philly pounds the alarm once more with new EP 'Trust Fall'. Razor sharp Baltimore club rhythms interlock with ballroom siren effects and acidic squelching, the EP's opener 'Core Work' rides high on this precedent and is an all out club hell raiser from start to finish!

2023 looks set to be yet another punching year for the Mullingar native having already released on GASH TRAX and with forthcoming trax set to come on labels like Headset.

The EP drops in full on June 1st via Bandcamp.
