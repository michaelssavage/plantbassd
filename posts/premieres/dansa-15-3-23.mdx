Ever-progressive Edinburgh based party series and label Palidrone offer up their second release, this time with sounds solely from the mind of co-founder @dansa_eh on his debut EP ‘Kill The Body and The Head Will Die’.

Our featured premiere ‘Algae’ is a robust drum runner filled with thundering kicks, glitching undercoats, alongside an array of alarming effects 🚨

The EP drops in full this Friday and has already gone on to receive plaudits from heads like Jamie XX, LCY, Solid Blake & more 🌐
