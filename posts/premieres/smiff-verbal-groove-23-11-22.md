Rising Scottish bass starlet, SMIFF lands his debut EP 'Verbal Groove' on Berlin based imprint SOWASVON. Making waves in both Scottish and UK circles, the Edinburgh based producer drops the release this Friday (25/11/22).

Featured title-track 'Verbal Groove' rides on a bass filled groove that leans heavy on smart sampling and revolving low ends.
