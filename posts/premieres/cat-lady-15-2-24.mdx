Cat Lady lands on BASS WATER FREAK OUT with the torpedo turbulence of the ‚Äú110, New Town‚Äù EP. Inspired by their move from NYC to Glasgow during the summer of 2021, it‚Äôs fast, hard and mischievous, just like their newly adopted city!

Our featured premiere ‚ÄòBB LOCK HEART‚Äô is a tunnel chasing hyper-electro steamer, comprised of nippy 808 foundations with elements of jersey and ghetto tech appearing regularly.

The EP is released in full on Feb 23rd here: <HoverLink url="https://basswaterfreakout.bandcamp.com/album/110-new-town" external /> üå±

All proceeds from the EP will be donated to Sea Shepherd Australia!
