With past releases on coveted labels like Future Bounce Werk & MATRACA, Bogota based Fourtwenty Sound shines further on 'LETS GET IT'.

Venezuelan, BogotÃ¡ based multi-genre producer Fourtwenty Sound lands on Scottish born Hyperdome Records as part of their forthcoming second V/A installation with 'LETS GET IT'.

A mutating bass and footwork number that fuses acidic whirls with crushing breakbeats and phonk breakdowns.
