The talented duo have already supported Partiboi69, Special Request, and our own Plantbassd organica series in the Workman's Cellar.

This featured premiere 'Prism' is an irresistable groove that packs in tight hypnotic drums with beautiful, drawn-out chords soaring and weaving over the top. Silky Klub have created a lush, dreamlike atmosphere that's both emotional and mesmerizing while adding a human touch with ethereal vocal samples punctuating the track.

Mark your calendars for April 16th, when you can get yours hands on the the whole EP at <HoverLink url="https://2sweetrecords.bandcamp.com/album/prism" name="Prism" inline external /> on Bandcamp ðŸŒ±
