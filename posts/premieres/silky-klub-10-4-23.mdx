<hr />

The pair have been growing their reputation as selectors on Ireland's club circuit in the last few years supporting the likes of Partiboi69 and Special Request, as well as featuring at our own Organica party in Dublin's Cellar Club last summer.

Our featured premiere 'Prism' is an irresistible groove packing in tight hypnotic drums alongside drawn-out chords that soar and weave over the rhythm. Silky Klub have created a lush, dreamlike atmosphere that's both emotional and mesmerizing whilst simultaneously adding human touch with tranquil vocal samples punctuating throughout.

Mark your calendars for April 16th, when you can get yours hands on the the whole EP at <HoverLink url="https://2sweetrecords.bandcamp.com/album/prism" name="Prism" inline external /> on Bandcamp ðŸŒ±
