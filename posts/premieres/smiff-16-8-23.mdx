Edinburgh bass starlet SMIFF is back on the drop with doublet of drum stacked edits, covering Big Boss Vette and a Masters At Work classic on his forthcoming 'Drum Reworks' EP.

We're featuring the young Scot's Seriously Drummy spin on Big Boss Vette's 'Pretty Girls Walk'. A kick heavy pump of the St. Louis rapper's booty trap anthem that fizzes over with tribal drum rolls, making way as a peak time club whacker!
