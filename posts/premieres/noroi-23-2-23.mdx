New sub-label of Rua Sound, @spheres_ie initializes with Rome-based act Noroi for a raw and atmospheric 4 tracker of deep jungle and breaks.

Noroiâ€™s â€˜Transoceanicâ€™ combines forceful breakbeat arrangements with gliding, uplifting synth pallets on the imprint based off the west coast of Ireland which seeks to house the darker side of the hardcore spectrum.
