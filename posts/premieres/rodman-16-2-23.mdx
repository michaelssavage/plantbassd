Fast becoming a staple name in Mexico City's underground scene, Rodman delivers a solid UK bass and techno driven debut EP with 'La Fragua' via the Discos Sentimiento imprint this coming March.

'Marejada' embodies a stuttered shuffle of weighted bass and off-kilter breaks with club seducing backgrounds & provocative hand drums. This is a must for fans of intelligent bass in liking to Al Wootton, Nicola Cruz, etc.
