A Breaking Concept (@abcrecordings) land their first release on their imprint with Rave Factory. A 20 track V/A from acts around the world carefully selected to speak for a clear concept, an edgier take on rave, breakbeat house, jungle techno, and oldschool hardcore bridged alongside elements of hip-hop, punk, rock, dub, R&B, house and techno,

Past, present and future combine on Michel Angeâ€™s â€˜Nineteen Ninety Oneâ€™ evoking old school hardcore NRG with an edgier view on breakcore.
