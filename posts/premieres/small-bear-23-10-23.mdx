The Dublin based avant-garde electroniq party, backed by Mark Davis (darkmavis), enters the label world with a collection of dreamy club efforts from some of the most gifted producers coming out of Ireland and afar.

Our featured premiere comes from the Dublin based Small Bear who delights with basement anthem 'Foamy Nites'. Propelling off a tightly locked 90s inspired breakbeat before merging with bass walls and alarming energies, it's a track that maintains its aggressive prowess throughout standing as an ideal dark room number.

A really promising first stab at it from Ethereal Skies, 'Aerga Vol. 1' arrives in full on November 17th here: <HoverLink url="etherealxxskies.bandcamp.com/album/aerga-vol-01" external /> ðŸŒ±
