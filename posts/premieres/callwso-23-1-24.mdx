Colombian label traaampaaa initiate for '24 with Callwso's 'LATA PARCHE CARDIO' EP. 4 original worx with a remixing effort from Cimarron, the Argentine artist creates distinctly unorthodox grooves with combinations of explosive percussion and intriguing South American rhythms & flavours.

'Limbo De Ubers' follows this foundation with a splendour of manipulated vocals, stark basslines and firm, intoxicating rhythm sections. A real tone-setter for the remainder of the EP, it's a track that unapologetically lures you in. A real dancefloor magnet.

The EP drops in full on the traaampaaa Bandcamp on January 31st here: <HoverLink url="https://traaampaaa.bandcamp.com/album/lata-parche-cardio" external /> ðŸŒ±
