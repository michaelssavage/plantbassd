Asa Nisi Masa sets the world alight with latest single 'Cobweb Thread'. A multi-faceted journey through sound that initiates so subtly with its xylophone arpeggio before ultimately transcending into a cacophony of a speeding basslines, thundering breakbeats and an electrifying guitar solo.

The Dublin native mines together an anthemic energy with club dimensions and orchestral suave that lands on all fours in a head melting fashion.
