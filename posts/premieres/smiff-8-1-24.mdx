Edinburgh drum lord SMIFF is getting right into it for '24 with the mouth-watering BANG! EP. 3 pulsating drum runners designed for, tested in, and proven at the club.

Our featured premiere of 'ClipSchwifter' is fizzing peak-time chaser comprised of deep kicks, sharp claps and provocative vocal trinkets. Tis a hardy wee number!

The EP drops in full on 12/1 here: <HoverLink url="https://smiffbreaks.bandcamp.com/album/bang-ep" external /> on Bandcamp ðŸŒ±
