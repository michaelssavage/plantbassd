Vell debuts on Bangkok's Boiled Wonderland Records with the electrified zap of 'Floating Mists, Warm Vistas' EP. 4 tracks of bubbling bass and electro transmissions that voyage through breakbeat situations and acidic bass lines featuring a sublime remix from the Dubai based Rudoh.

Our featured premiere is the Rudoh reimagining of 'Burning Trees', which is given a breakbeat makeover of epic atmospheric proportions. Commanding bass, thick kicks and ethereal breakdowns with pinches of rave. It's a bit of a cracker.

The EP drops in full on September 22nd here: <HoverLink url="https://vellmusic.bandcamp.com/album/floating-mists-warm-vistas-w-rudoh-remix" external /> ðŸŒ±
