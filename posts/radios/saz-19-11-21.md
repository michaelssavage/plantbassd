### Next up to grace our mix series is SAZ! 24 year old electronic DJ from Meath, Ireland.

A past contributor on Dublinâ€™s @phevertv, Sarah has been tapping into a range of house sub genres while bringing elements of disco into her mixes. Saz notably takes great inspiration from artists like Adam Pits, whose productions sheâ€™s been greatly fond of over the last few years.

Her mixing style has pushed her to share her tastes on @auroraevents mix series as well as a recent guest appearance for the @decorum_music boys on Scotlandâ€™s @project.radio.

Her guest mix for us features tracks from Occibel, Marlon Hoffstadt, Loods, Vitess & more. One to prepare us all for the weekend!
