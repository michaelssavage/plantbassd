### Next up to grace our mix series is SAZ! 24 year old electronic DJ from Meath, Ireland.

A past contributor on Dublin's @phevertv, Sarah has been tapping into a range of house sub genres while bringing elements of disco into her mixes. Saz notably takes great inspiration from artists like Adam Pits, whose productions she's been greatly fond of over the last few years.

Her mixing style has pushed her to share her tastes on @auroraevents mix series as well as a recent guest appearance for the @decorum_music boys on Scotland's @project.radio.

Her guest mix for us features tracks from Occibel, Marlon Hoffstadt, Loods, Vitess & more. One to prepare us all for the weekend!
