### Our mix series returns with a special all-vinyl mix from Cabal co-founder and director, Colm Brandon!

Since it’s formation in Limerick in 2017, @cabal.ie has established itself as one of the leading party series in Ireland and it is ready to set its eyes on a new scene post lockdown.

The Cabal brand has become synonymous in Irish music, fashion and art with its consistent loyalty to up and coming Irish talents and creatives. In their own words, ‘a large part of Cabal’s identity is embracing it’s inherently Irish roots, and promoting the Irish creative scene whether it be music, fashion or art’.

Their return to club land is greatly anticipated after their highly successful courtyard parties at the University of Limerick, and the sell out monthly shows and live streams in Galway and Limerick that they have maintained over the past few years gaining significant approval.
Acts they have showcased include @skreamizm, @rkitt4eva, @brame.hamo @sallycberlin, as well as hosting @boilerroomtv and their Bass & Percs tour.

Cabal is still very much in the morning of its enterprise but it’s growth in such a short space of time is inspiration for all in the industry with communal ideals.

The many exciting projects that were dashed during the pandemic will soon come to fruition again and we can’t wait to be apart of it with them!
