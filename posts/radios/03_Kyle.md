### Next installment in our mix series is from Bournemouth’s @lokeycollective co-founder Kyle!

Having crossed paths with Kyle at @warehouse_raves Festival during the summer, we very quickly bonded over a fondness of hard dubs as we took in sets from the likes Djrum and Tommy Holohan.

Kyle shares sounds from Ilian Tape, Hessle Audio, and Livity Sound on this all-vinyl masterclass.

Being an avid party thrower in Bournemouth as well as having racked up shows on @rinsefrance and running @lockdowncommunityradio, we are more than thrilled to have an entry from Kyle.

For lovers of hard riddimz!
