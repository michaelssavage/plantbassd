I've been listening to a massive year of heavy low-end energy on strong percussive releases. Leftfield Bass and the whole Breakbeat sound is seeing huge movement and I was treated to some lethal tunes. Here's my top 10:

## 1. INGI - Wrestle (Fly By Night Recordings)

<div class="row">
<div class="col top-ten-2021">

</div>
<div class="col top-ten-2021">

Precise programmed drums hitting hard in this EP. Big fan of the use of the vocal chops and atmospheric mood. I reckon this would blow the place up of any club. Can't wait to hear it!

## 2. Kempston Hardwick - Mowbray Street (Lobster Theremin)

</div>
<div class="col top-ten-2021">

Kempston Hardwick deserves so much more attention for his groovy tracks. His name stands out, the cover art is gorgeous, and he's releasing on powerhouse label, Lobster Theremin. The first track, Mowbray Street, will make you move your feet and that energy lets up.

<div class="col top-ten-2021">

Put this EP on, sit down, and zone out. Logic1000 is so good at creating hypnotizing harmonies and I love the clean Garage sound sitting neatly in the spacious production.
