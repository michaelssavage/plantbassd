Wake up wake up wake up, it’s the first of the month! February is upon us, and after a scintillating return to clubbing last week another hell bent schedule is in store this week in the capital. As will be the norm for us now, we once again bring you our top picks and highlights forthcoming in Edinburgh’s experimental dance music community in this second edition of our weekly club guide.

**TUESDAY 1st**

-   <p> Midnight Bass // Jungle Special @ Bongo Club </p>

After a stellar re-opening edition last week where a reimagining of Hogmanay was celebrated to an ever lively Midnight Bass crowd, they return to their Bongo Tuesday slot with a jungle special featuring Edinburgh hard-hitters Feena, Clean-Up Crew, and REYKA. A recent addition to the Scuffed Records family, Feena (Miss World) has become renowned in the capital's club circles for her bass-driven sounds and knack for all things breaks.

In addition, Clean-Up Crew bring one of the liveliest sets to any party and are ever-guilty (in the best possible way) for treading in 200bpm waters. A consistent genre-fluid releaser, REYKA completes a very appetizing main room bill as Midnight Bass morphs into jungle form once more. Expect UKG and breaks in room 2 from more Edinburgh talent. This is one of our top picks for the week!

**WEDNESDAY 2nd**

-   <p> Heaters // Haptic All Night Long @ Sneaky Pete’s </p>

Heaters breathes new life with a run of new residents on Sneaky’s Wednesdays. First of the month is Kirkcaldy crew Haptic who host a 4 hour slot with their very own Bartek and Freddy. As always, you can expect an array of club ready sounds from the Haptic crew spanning UKG, dub-techno, breaks, & really anything in between and beyond! Haptic will now be operating the first Wednesday slot of each month for Heaters with plenty more exciting shows to follow.

Volens Chorus return to their spiritual home with another imminent hard-hitting show, this time with Glasgow’s own Casement and a helping hand from the crew’s own residents. Recent releases with Australian label Third Degree and consistent stellar self-releases, Casement is one of the central belt’s finest purveyors of bass-driven club sounds. We expect a perfect match with Edinburgh’s bass specialists Volens Chorus this Thursday with Sneaky’s ready to rattle. Another of our top picks for the week in Cowgate!
