All Together Now (ATN) returns to Curraghmore Estate in Co Waterford for its fourth instalment with a packed out selection of artists, entertainers, and vendors. Fans are eager to let loose, practically foaming at the mouth for any sort of party after a wet and windy July. The weather is looking to hold out for most of the time at the grounds so get your dancing shoes and ponchos ready. ATN have cast a wide net to appease different music heads but their electronic choices are top notch.

Generating plenty of electric buzz for us are the likes of James Murphy (LCD Soundsystem), Le Boom, Palms Trax, Skatebard, Todd Terje, Tourist, and Warmduscher but if you are feeling energised and wanting more then hot on our radar are Daniel Avery, Jamie XX, LB AKA LABAT, Luxe, Moktar, Overmono, Partiboi69, and Surusinghe.

An unmissable act, we can’t wait to see again is **Daphni** after he played in the short-lived venue Jam Park in Dublin in 2019. He is playing on _Saturday night at 1am at the ‘Something Kind Of Wonderful’ stage_. If you are too tired to stay up, you can catch his benevolent side as **Caribou** on _Saturday at 10pm at the main stage_. Even better, catch the live drummer of Caribou, **Coy Haste**, playing back to back with Dublin-based DJ **Moving Still** also on _Saturday at 6pm at The Circle_.

Coming down from the capital, we’ve got electronic goodness from different collectives like Skin and Blister (**EMA** and **Mercorn**), Club Comfort (**Selky**), and Sim Simma (**Ben Bix**). Hard hitting techno coming from vinyl only sets from Waterford’s own **Cailín**. If the energy is starting to deplete Saturday night at 12.15am and you can’t hack the techno, then vibe out to R&B and hip-hop from **Bricknasty** at The Circle. But if you’re desiring something new, scratch that itch with some GaelicDrill from **Selló**. A fusion of traditional Irish Culture with the modern drill sound.

To the west of the country is another Gaeilge promotor, **Shampain**, who is oozing with confidence after smashing the Big Top Tent at the Galway International Arts Festival this year. Expect a large Connacht presence with the YAWLAG collective making their mark at the Éalu Le Grá area with **Burlie Mac** leading the way with soulful House jams. If you're down by the _Cambium Club on Friday at 8.30pm_, don't miss label owner and Jungle aficionado **Rob Rua**!

Northern Ireland is home of the AVA festival and has some top names ready to party this weekend. Belfast is bringing it’s best with the likes of **Holly Lester** commanding dancefloors, **Jordan Nocturne** supplying feel-good vibes akin to Gerd Janson, and **Sally C** showing off her distinct Electro and Techno flair alongside Spray. Coming from just over the border in Donegal, **Pagan** is ready to smash the Arcadia stage and have his audience primed for Partiboi69 afterwards.

Two to look out for coming from the Kingdom are **Shee** with his groovy production and DJ style, and **New Jackson** (David Kitt) with his more laid back relaxing style of electronica. Kitt will be directing the music at the _Something Kind Of Wonderful stage on Friday at 8pm_ with his acoustic sounds too. One we won't miss in particular is CABAL co-founder, **Sloucho**, with his genre-bending hyper-pop and glitchy dub productions.
