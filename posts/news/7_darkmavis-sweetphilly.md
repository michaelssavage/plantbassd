### @darkpmavis & @phillyholmes\_ have just dropped a club EP full of pink and sparkly bangers for you all!

Forging sounds of trance, house, avant-garde pop, and nods to old school jungle & hardcore breaks, the pair have come together and aligned their respective sounds creating catchy energetic club music.

Davis (@craneclubdub) & Holmes have cracked a knack on this release for building songs from an initial soft point and into peak time anthems.

Title track ‘Euphore’ crafts this aforementioned energetic build effortlessly, and other tracks on the release ‘Stabbed’ and ‘5pm’ have rightfully been given the premiere spotlight from @djmagofficial And @fourfourmagazine respectively for their enthusing sounds.

Available to stream on all platforms now & for purchase on Bandcamp! https://euphore.bandcamp.com/releases
