### To celebrate 5 years of releases, Of Paradise return with the 4th installment of their V/A series, featuring efforts from the likes of @oallhates, @iazarus, and @strattontrax.

We spoke to label runners Paul Patterson and @fadeofparadise about the challenges involved in putting together a compilation, the outlook of the label, the idea of being aesthetically underground, and more.

The label has worked with a host of exciting names on past releases highlighting a raw take on dub house, techno, trance and breaks, with Vol. 4 showing no sign of veering away from this club-friendly sound.

The sounds that have come from the Of Paradise imprint have never been shy to experiment, with this installment of the compilation journeying through downtempo electro to pacing club pounds.

From Fade’s cagey and suspense filled breaks on ‘Protocol’ to Stratton’s dance tent bounce on ‘Double Happiness’, the label shows you exactly what they mean.

The compilation is available for purchase now on Bandcamp. Some fantastic tools on this one: https://ofparadise.bandcamp.com/album/of-paradise-vol-4
