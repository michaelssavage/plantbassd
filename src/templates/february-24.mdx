>
  A vicious take on the recent Justice single that has seen the French duo respark across the world
  ahead of the fast approaching summer festival season. Glasgow talent SOOAKXA envisions what the
  pair may sound like inna UK hardcore style, and it’s pure rocket fuel.

  embed="track=2935896623"
>
  He’s back with another wun. L-VIS has sparked the hype train once again in recent weeks with his
  first new music under the moniker since 2018. There’s set to be a whole lot more where that came
  from as the man sometimes known as Dance System sets out to release 16 new dubs in 16 weeks. 13
  more to go!

  soundcloudEmbed="https://soundcloud.com/jack-fanciulli/bleedin-rollarcoaster-2"
>
  A genuine contender for the title of Ireland’s most exciting electronic acts in recent years, Asa
  Nisi Masa returns with another electrifying instrumental hybrid. ‘Thousand Mistakes, Million
  Regrets’ zings with its sultry indie guitar riffs, hazy lyricism, and a cacophony of deep breaks,
  kicks & synths.

  soundcloudEmbed="https://soundcloud.com/lostikigai/dj-accident-at-work-the-bot-send-the-address"
>
  The undisputed master of drillectro returns. DJ Accident At Work is back with a new home for his
  sounds under the Lost Ikigai banner (formerly Reality Club). ‘Send The Address’ lands as the first
  release on the Glasgow based imprint alongside fellow citizen The Bot and packs a serious analogue
  punch, running alongside the re-energised lyrics of Dave & Central Cee’s ‘Sprinter’.

  title="Exiles by Async Figure"
  link="https://asyncfigure.bandcamp.com/album/exiles"
  embed="album=3465694134"
>
  Async Figure continue on their breathtaking form with four multi-functional tracks on Exiles. The
  UK duo continuously excite and engage with layered RnB soaked club on ‘Quero Evangel’, to the epic
  synth stutter of ‘F Anthem’. The tripped out reggaeton vibrations on ‘Rumour Zone’ & ‘Optimist
  Reset’s’ ominous orchestral breakdowns further push this narrative.

  title="Stone Hardware EP by Galtier & Druid"

  embed="album=3632261670"
>
  The ever formidable Nostro Hood System bangs back in 2024 with a double-barrel opening release
  from label boss Galtier & Synes co-founder Druid. 4 tracks comprising both solo & collaborative
  works, the duo thrive on tribal tinged drum pumps and shuffling electro steppers throughout. ‘Body
  Horror’ stands out as a true epic amidst the rest.

  title="Myogi 妙義 by Dirty K"
  link="https://dirtykkkk.bandcamp.com/album/myogi"
  embed="album=26574806"
>
  No one does party anthems quite like Dirty K. Even if they do, they certainly don’t manipulate &
  revitalise them quite the way he can. Sometimes I don’t think he even realises how party he
  sounds. Does he? Throughout Dirty K’s work you’ll hear intricate stamps of dance music’s original
  fabrics alongside the sonics of East Asia rave. Rarely are samples used to such devastating
  effects, in the club sense, than when the Manchester based artist throws his spin on them. Myogi
  妙義’s 5 original works (including a collab with T5UMUT5UMU) continue Dirty K’s seemingly
  relentless onslaught of blitzkrieg club. Also including not-so-bloody-shabby reworks from WRACK,
  pìccolo, and Sonia Calico.

  title="HEADSET005 by Usurp"
  link="https://headset-scotland.bandcamp.com/album/headset005"
  embed="album=519011498"
>
  HEADSET returns with its ongoing showcase of prime Scottish rave cuts. 005 sees Dumfries native
  Usurp deliver a blend of club uppers and relaxers, combining off-kilter rave stabs, frazzling
  speed breaks, and sub zero drum rollers across 5 hits. Available on wax more importantly, as well
  as digitals. The EP closer ‘Birdsong’ is a quite incredible track also (P.S.!!).

  title="WITNESS05 by One Eye Witness"

  embed="album=2126638633"
>
  Dutch imprint One Eye Witness brings together 4 imprint favourites in Priori, Eversines,
  O’FourtyFour & Reflex Blue. Landing as the the 5th release on the label, it comes with further
  glorification of the unconventional club sounds that have shaped it do date, revolving through
  smoky minimalist tech house, acidic 90s flavas, rickety two step funk, and analogistic breakbeat
  punch.

  title="Florilegi V/A by ABUNDANCE"
  link="https://abundanceisyou.bandcamp.com/album/florilegi-i"
  embed="album=926821916"
>
  Barcelona-based creative network ABUNDANCE released their first V/A back in January, Florilegi I.
  Meaning a ‘collection of flowers’ in Catalan, the compilation offers an aural glimpse into the
  city’s vibrant underground ecosystem which by all accounts here sounds brimmed with a fiery zest
  of swagger and pride. The imprint is dedicated to championing the city’s endless talents and
  serves as a non-profit artistic collective, record label and event organisation. This lands as the
  11th record on the label and might just stand as the most impressive yet. Tuck into this one,
  there really is something for all tastes!

  embed="album=880003236"
>
  Tunes to scratch your brain in the right way. Forward thinking techno that’s light on its feet,
  fresh with texture, and ever evolving into new territories. Ploy remains exciting throughout the
  EP with his use of trippy FX to give his five lovely releases plenty of momentum.
