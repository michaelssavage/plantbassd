The mixtape is free to download and listen on Bandcamp: <HoverLink url="wriggledublin.bandcamp.com/album/the-comeback" external />

Our first edition features the recent drop from <HoverLink url="www.instagram.com/dg_353/" name="@dg_353" external /> (DG) on Dublin bass label Wriggle. DG shares his insights with us into the process of making this mixtape, the art of sampling, and his views on the current/ future state of Irish night life.

'The Comeback' is a concept mixtape about an imaginary group of hungover musicians playing a set in a pub in the sticks after a night of heavy boozing and passing out in ditches! It is a move away from the usual dubstep and bass sounds that we have received from past DG and Wriggle releases.

Smooth hip-hop and jazzy riddims on this one, doused in a Dilla-esque dressing of smart sampling and sharp percussion and instrumentals. It's ideal listening for those lazy hot summer afternoons where you crave music to lounge to.

EP in full on his @itsnotradio show this Friday night.
