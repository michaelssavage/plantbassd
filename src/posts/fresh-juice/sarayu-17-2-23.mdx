Inspired by the wealth of bass derived club music coming out of the UK, Europe and beyond, Sarayu began with DJing in 2008, progressing on to push his own label and record store in the time since, as well as honing in on his production skills more recently in 2021. Popping up at clubs and parties around the world while also being a staple name in his home Bangkok, he has brought with him his intuitive sound in techno, electro and bass to venues such as Fabric, Village Underground and Zukunft, and played alongside dance music pioneers like Frankie Knuckles, Kenny Dope, Ben UFO, and more.

After establishing his tracks on his own <HoverLink url="morerice.bandcamp.com/" name="More Rice" external /> imprint as well as providing to <HoverLink url="fufurecords.com/" name="FuFu Records" external /> over the last two years, Sarayu’s next venture in sound takes a deeper, darker focused club view with the 4 track ‘Intelligent Jump Rope Music’, teaming up with the essential Locked Groove who jumps in on remix duties.

Spending much of his formative years based in the UK, Sarayu believes such influences have nestled into his now well respected production style.
“I think my upbringing certainly influences the way I DJ and produce. I often listen back to tracks from the post dubstep era and acknowledge the influence this has had on my own tracks. Whether it is in my sound selection or the way I structure tunes, my focus is always on creating dancefloor orientated music”.

His impressive introduction on Boiled Wonderland begins with the EP’s opening track ‘The Bag’. A hypnotic bass groove that ebbs and flows amidst crisp hats & snares and an ever shuffling kick structure.

The darkly mutating electro of ‘E30 Track’ presses all the right buttons with its gurgling basslines, surging hats and high pitched pad effects. It is during its breakdown that the track really comes alive with its shadowing synth lined progressions creating even further advanced club tensions.

More reserved in its tempo, title track ‘Intelligent Jump Rope Music’ makes up for the loss in BPM with its deep ridged bass surges, creating a dense platform for its vibrating kicks and acidic repeaters. Airy effects filter through the background highlighting Sarayu’s ability to create multiple energies within the same track. It could be described as anything from dubstep, to house, or UK bass.

Locked Groove gives the same track an uplifting house retouch, replacing the thwarting bass and kicks with a flotation of ever so acidic synth chords and a more four-to-the-floor focused rhythm development. A hug-friendly rave track that is blessed for the calmer hours of the morning.

Sarayu continues to ride this current crested wave with the triumphant ‘Intelligent Jump Rope Music’ showcasing the Thai star’s boundless club styles. We can put our trust in this as one of the standout releases of 2023 so far. Waste time no further and get on it.
