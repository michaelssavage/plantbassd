Clubbing and normality as it were return this week after a frustrating month long hiatus in Scotland.

The capital is back with a bang with a very appetizing string of parties across the Cowgate and surrounding area from tonight onward. We will be highlighting the top club nights each week, profiling the best dance and experimental club nights that Edinburgh has to offer.

  battle it out in the main room with a helping hand from Elektrikal Sound. Room 2 receives a dosage
  of UKG from SMIFF, Siskin, and our own OIS√çN. Always a fun party with Midnight Bass.
