intro: "Key-In (Cian Gilvarry) provides his favourite picks of the year highlighting his appetite for slower tempo electronic tunes that hit hard with impactful low-end goodness and textured drums. Key-In Events are Galway based parties that offer stripped-back, no bull**** late night experiences, encouraging less phone usage, and more emphasis on dancing. With Sputnik One, Facta, and soon Simo Cell locked in, Key-In solidifies his position as the most promising DJ and party promoter in the west of the country."

  One of the tracks of the year for me. Heard it being teased all summer by the Hessle boys and
  companions. So so good. Great to see Midland out producing club perfected tracks once again.
  Perfect prime time club track this.

  Lovely chuggy roller from the top tier Madrid run label ears on earth. Been rinsing this since may
  when I stumbled upon it on my Bandcamp feed. Perfect and progressive with a nice little punch to
  it. Pure class.

>
  K-Lone's masterpiece edit from his Sweet N Tasty edits label. Would stick this into any set where
  it is possible. Slow BPM bass weighted dancehall chugger that is very danceable. Everything about
  it is perfect for setting the tone of a set.

  Another EP this year that I rinsed. Her set at ATN (All Together Now) had me all over this after
  seeing her live. Full of punchy wobbly tracks with a lovely remix of “Moonquake” by Angel D’Lite.

  Took this one off the Woozy 3.5 comp. Sick, no explanation needed. Anyone who listens to

>
  Dark garagey wobblers and rollers. Built for the club. Dark and driving bass straight through,
  especially ‘Big Devil Energy’ and ‘How We Feelin’. A lot of what I look for if I’m gathering
  tracks for a set.
