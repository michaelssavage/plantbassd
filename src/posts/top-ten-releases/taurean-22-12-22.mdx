2022 was an amazing year for fast-paced, euphoric eurotrance and DJ Heartstring exemplified that with this remix of DJ Dolphin's 'Grand V'. Feels like driving along a motorway to the airport at 5am – full of possibility

We were blessed with the release of Dubyshkin's 'The Botox Queen' EP in the summer of this year, but for me this track stands out among the rest. Crisp snares and dreamy vocals ensure that this goes down a treat on the dancefloor.

The intersection of grime/drill with techno was one of my favourite things to come out of 2022, with artists like Skin on Skin taking the blending of these genres to a whole other level. This track by Irish producer Charlie Murphy takes Central Cee's 'Khabib' and turns it into a club-ready anthem that is guaranteed to get you bouncing.

While we're on the topic of blending genres, Nia Archives just treated us to this jungle edit of Skin on Skin's viral track via Stay on Sight records, off the back of her stellar Boiler Room set in October, totally taking it to another level. Nia is without a doubt one of my standout artists this year and I can't wait to see what else she brings to the table.

<div className="col clubGuide">

When I sat down to put this list together, I actually couldn't believe that this track was only released this year, it feels like it's been a part of me forever. Two Shell went above and beyond to mix vocals that sound like they're straight from outer space with a snappy breakbeat and bubbly melody to make the pop-inspired uk dub tune of your dreams.

Groove is the name of the game with this one, without a doubt one of my favourite tracks to play out at the moment. It's sharp, it's rhythmic, it's all of the other adjectives that you want a groovy dance track to be \<3 The perfect edit for building energy and suspense during a set, it's available as a free download on SoundCloud too which just makes it even sexy-er.

Anyone lucky enough to witness Bicep's live show in person this year will appreciate the beauty of this track. Clara La San's floaty, angelic vocals blend perfectly with the Belfast duo's atmospheric sound, this one makes me feel like summer is only a second away.

Sonic Intel released the most perfect 'Groove Infinity' VA in the summer, featuring 5 hard-hitting tracks by some of Ireland's most talented producers. Label curator Infiltrator takes the cake on this one, with his track Groovetracer bringing hypnotic beats and a dark, warpy vocal sample to the fore. This entire VA is absolutely worth checking out.

Not really sure if this last track counts because it's been one of those elusive, 'only found via a youtube bootleg' tracks for the past 9 years, however Burial and Four Tet finally decided to release Nova across platforms in February, leading to its resurgence. This track is absolutely timeless, a dreamy journey with distinctive Four Tet-esque drum patterns combined with the atmospheric sounds intrinsic to Burial's music. One of my favourites of all time and I'm delighted it's been freed from the shackles of Youtube music!!
