### SweatBox welcomes one of the UK's most sought after selectors Neffa-T to the Stereo alongside Glasgow 140 hero Rapture 4D, Edinburgh bass queen Feena, and Fuse founder VAJ.Power !

A Bristolian technician known for his epic blends through dubstep, bass and techno with infamous sets on Keep Hush and HOR Berlin alongside acts like Flowdan, Neffa-T just knows how to push it. His meteoric rise has been punctuated by remarkable achievements, including his mind-blowing 6-deck technical mix, which garnered global recognition when shared by the esteemed Pioneer brand. He fearlessly traverses genres, seamlessly blending 140, dubstep, grime, Techno, and beyond to create a mesmerising fusion of sound. #

Glasgow 140 champion and PLASMA dada Rapture 4D brings his expertise on grime and dubstep in to the mix on the night. A former Beatboss 5 winner, this guy has appeared on labels like Terrorhythm, Scotch Bonnet and Astral Black, played alongside acts like Giggs, AJ Tracey, and CasISDead to name but a few, and has just returned back from a recent tour of the states.

Feena and VAJ.Power go head to head to open the eve, set to journey through their extensive selections within the bass music continuum. This pair have been cutting their teeth on the Scottish circuit for some years now and stand as some of the key figures in the country's underground, be it as producers, spinners, promoters, visual artists, and writers.
