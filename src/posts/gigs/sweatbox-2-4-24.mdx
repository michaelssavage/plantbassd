### IT'S TIME TO END THE CONFUSION.

SweatBox HAS HACKED INTO THE GLOBAL BANK TO DEFY ALL CURRENCY CONVERSIONS. IT'S ABOUT TIME €1=£1

EURO DJ = UK DJ.

IT'S ALL THE SAME TO US FOLKS.

Spring SweatBox sees an influx of French disc jockeys take to our shores. We thought it would be really cute to lock them in a bassment in Glasgow city centre for 4 hours with some Scottish (based) disc jockeys to see how they get on =D

LET'S PLAY!

Lyon acts Pastresdrole, Maelita & Subsism make their Scotland d€buts with us alongside 4 Glasgow residing sup£rstars in ALK E P b2b r333cluse & dtshanks b2b oBrother.

Tickets £5 & rising! Please keep an eye on the markets. Inflation is REAL!
