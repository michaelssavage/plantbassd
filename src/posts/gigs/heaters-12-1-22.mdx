### We takeover Heaters with a special headline slot from the ever palpable TAALHIAH!

Fresh off of her incredible debut album 'Angelica' and a run of notable shows at Glasgow's Riverside Festival & a live performance at Sneaky's for Stag and Dagger Fest to name but a few, it is only fitting to have her back in the capital for a 2 hour DJ set for the full on sweaty walls and ballistic Cowgate crowd experience!

Irish club experimentalist Sweet Philly and new local duo and Sneaky's familiars Lucky Dip will be on hand to bolster the typical Plant Bass'd SweatBox NRG on the night from 11-1am!

This is a night for everyone. A night of creative expression through hate defying and freedom inspiring hard trax! Leave your stresses and dress codes at home.
£5 on RA/ £7 OTD.

RA Tickets Available through the link in our bio.
