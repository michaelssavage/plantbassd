### SweatBox and Lucky Dip are honoured to bring the Colombian LatinTek blaster CRRDR to Scotland for the very first time!

ARRIBA!!!!

A current spearhead of the hard dance scene in Colombia and wider Latin America, CRRDR's menacing sounds flip up elements of techno, gabber and hard trance with the sounds of their nation; Perreo, guaracha, UwUaracha & dembow. It's all spewed up in a ferocious fast paced manner, and it's taking over the WORLD!

Bolstering the sound on the night we have Glasgow residing LatinX specialists in Loreto and Yo Perreo Solx's Indigo who have both been pushing LATAM sounds in the city over the last few years with residencies at illustrious queer venue Bonjour!

Lucky Dip's CLO & strawb.bby as well as SweatBox & Plant Bass'd founder oBrother also clash for a heated B3B forking their usual hard dance steppers!

Stage Design & more to be revealed OTD!

This is a biggie. A Scottish debut! Catch the CRRDR while they're here!
