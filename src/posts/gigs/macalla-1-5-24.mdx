### Plant Bass'd are teaming up with Macalla for a special Galway launch party ahead of the festival's debut entry this July 20th at Keadeen Mountain Farm in Co. Wicklow.

One of the country's most exciting new festivals, Macalla has been forged to create a unique fusion of Gaeilge and soundsystem culture across an action packed day with names like the Ragga Twins, 0phelia and founder Misha Freshin already confirmed.

For this West Coast spesh we've invited along some of the countries brightest along offering a snippet into the sounds and vibes expected at the festival with Dublin UKG specialist MathMan, Téigh Síos founder Kelsey, and Galway junglist Stella, alongside Plant Bass'd's own oBrother b2b Michael Average.

Expect transmissions in 140, dubstep, UKG, jungle, bass, breaks and more for this one!

We are in Cuba nightclub from 10.30pm to finish. Macalla tickets and info links available below x
