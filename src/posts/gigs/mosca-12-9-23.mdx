### Soilse and SweatBox unite in dance for the first time, initiating with UK formidables Mosca and Swimful alongside Glasgow stalwart Plantainchipps @ our ceremonious home of Stereo

Testing the outerlimits of grime, dubstep, bass, funky, hard drum and techno, we bring together two of the UK scene's most valuable assets and unsung heroes in Mosca and Swimful for a dubious double headline situation.

This pair will spin it all. From garage anthems to promiscuous low end bass hummers, Mosca has produced and played it out throughout the land. Since cutting his teeth on Rinse with nostalgic bangers like 'What U Came For' to crafting one of the most unpredictable back catalogues there is on his RENT label, the London spinner has now championed the UK for well over a decade.

Be it creating foundations for future facing rappers like Yung Lean collaborator Yayoyanoh, or panelling grime tinged bass rattles on the Shanghai notorious SVBKVLT imprint, few have came close to Swimful in the skill and nous department in recent years.

On support we have one of Glasgow's key players in Club Noire founder Plantainchipps. A talented producer of amapiano and tribal tinged drum numbers, as well as being a mixer through both ends of the pop and bass continuums, they have become one of the city's go-to selectors for some time now at venues like Bonjour, Berkeley Suite, as well as Stereo supporting the likes of Byrell The Great and Jacques Greene.

A collision of sounds and minds, Soilse and SweatBox have always shared the clubbing ethos of sharing true music and implementing safe spaces. We're delighted to power up together to bring the city some of the more intriguing acts and lineups from the underground.

A party and dance for us all. Come find yourself x

AS ALWAYS WE OPERATE A SAFE SPACE AND PLACE FOR ALL THE DANCERS. WE OPERATE GENDER NEUTRAL TOILETS, DANCE FLOOR MONITORING AND THE SWIFT REMOVAL OF ANY PERSONS MAKING THE VIBES UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ANYONE ELSE.

Dress to sweat x
