### Stereo join forces with SweatBox & Soilse to bring Cairo bass experimentalist ZULI (irsh) to the club for a Scotland performance with local force on support in MM (Async Figure), DIJA (TAQA) & slyn (Subcity)

Internationally, ZULI is best known for his releases on Lee Gamble’s UIQ – which included a string of EPs as well as his debut LP Terminal, an album that highlighted the depth in his productions, as he simultaneously combines experimentations in rap/hip-hop with music for listening as well as the dancefloor. The Italian Haunter Records also saw the release of the infamous Trigger Finger EP which went on to be remixed by the likes of TSVI, AYA, Acre and more.

In 2019, ZULI and fellow Cairene DJ Rama launched the platform 'irsh' that started as a video series and became a label and clubnight.

Locally in Cairo, ZULI is best known for his work in the Hip-hop scene, particularly with rapper Abyusif, but also in the Electronic music scene as part of the now defunct collective Kairo Ist Koming (KIK) between 2012-2015. He co-founded Cairo’s alternative music venue and club VENT which existed between 2013-2015 before transforming the project into a namesake clubnight and festival.

ZULI’s music garners support all over the board ranging from the likes of Aphex Twin and Autechre, to Ben UFO and Bradley Zero, even Richie Hawtin through its wide ranging sound.
