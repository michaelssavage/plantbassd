Plant Bass'd returns to Dublin, this time to Workman's Club with the launch of our new Organica series!

Organica aims to focus on locally sourced spinners serving up the hot club sounds of ballroom, US club, electro, ghetto tech, footwork, techno & more.

Opening up our FREE launch party sees <HoverLink url="www.instagram.com/etheartistdublin" name="@etheartistdublin" external />, <HoverLink url="www.instagram.com/jennhession" name="@jennhession" external />, <HoverLink url="www.instagram.com/silkyklub" name="@silkyklub" external />, and <HoverLink url="www.instagram.com/phillyholmes_" name="@phillyholmes_" external /> taking on the Workmans Cellar.

We are thrilled to be back home after our stellar night at Wigwam and hope to see you all there again!

This is a night for everyone. Leave your stresses and dress codes at home and immerse in the hate defying and freedom inspiring hard trax!
