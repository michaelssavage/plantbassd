### We’re bringing the World Cup back to the summer here at Plant Bass’d!

Forging together nations in CLUB! Representing South America, Bogotá based producer and selector BRENDA joins us for a journey through the depths of Latin tek via Perreo, Guaracha, Baile & more!

Alongside two of the Edinburgh circuit’s most exciting spinners in the Shahrazadi duo. From Palestine to Kurdistan, the pair inspired by Azadi —- FREEDOM — and the age old Middle Eastern tradition of partying the night away blending hip-hop with sounds from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa in a most raucous energetic way, the only way they know how!

To boot, Volens Chorus’ quarterpoundernocheese and Lucky Dip’s CLO pay homage to the US of A with an all out Jersey Club set, with the latter’s other half strawb.bby and our own oBrother set to educate on all things Irish grown {"<"}3

NATIONS COLLIDE and NATIONS COMBINE in a fight for FREEDOM, LOVE & CLUB!

Let the games BEGIN!
