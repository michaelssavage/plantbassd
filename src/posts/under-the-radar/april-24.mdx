>
  First Funky Adjacent compilation. Third Funky Adjacent release. Nine burgeoning producers. Three
  continents represented. One mission succeeded; A rich tapestry of sounds, weaving together
  elements of pan-African club genres, techno and bass with classic UK Funky bounce. Fun,
  mischievous percussion & wobbly basses from the likes of Burna with â€˜Peak Hourâ€™ and Ovid with
  â€˜Contingencyâ€™. LÃºnasaâ€™s contribution goes hard incorporating a multitude of samples giving the
  track non-stop energy and freshness throughout. Perfect for the encroaching Summer festies.

  embed="album=134831079"
>
  Big-sound-small-space group Ar Ais ArÃ­s gather their ensemble of past party DJs for a well thought
  out club release. The fab five on the line showcase their bass studded productions and it embodies
  AAAâ€™s vibe to the absolute max. Volume 1 serves as an outstanding pilot EP with plays coming
  across the world from the likes of the Hessle Audio gang. Doubt, Plus One, SLOUCHO, Roo
  Honeychild, and a Luke Kiid edit on the creds.

  link="https://system108.bandcamp.com/album/nine-years-of-love-part-2"
  embed="album=1038781081"
>
  Artist Ira Bespalova curates filthy electro-armored jams for the two part V/A. Choose at random
  from any of the nine tracks to fully test the limits of your speakers. â€˜Lakad Matatagâ€™ by Any Act
  surrounds your head with a nasty sidechained stereo bass, â€˜wig splitâ€™ by skrpump boosts the bpm
  with some breaks, and â€˜Electro Systemâ€™ by Trust True closes the V/A with distortion at its limit.
  Cherry on top with â€˜Chevo Chevoâ€™ by Locked Club appearing after a tough year for their crew. True
  punks of the electro scene showing the very real avant-garde of rave in Russia atm.

>
  Chicago-inspired footwork from afar. Manchester based crew Brick Sweat Records curate a stripped
  back collection of club selects. â€˜Beastie Ballsâ€™ by DJ Ends lands on top for us with the glitchy
  use of bballin samples.

  title="5. The Journey by Dj Babatr"
  link="https://djbabatr.bandcamp.com/album/the-journey"
  embed="album=251375723"
>
  Granddaddy Dj Babatr boldly reimagines electronic music within the nation's unique context,
  shaping and redefining the global landscape with Raptor House, also known as changa tuki. Here he
  releases a mixed bag of moods. â€˜The Journeyâ€™ is a soothing House opener that misleads your
  expectations for the rest of the EP. â€˜In The Grooveâ€™ stomps along with a teasing Love Parade
  synth, with â€˜XPansion Moveâ€™ and â€˜In The Jungleâ€™ continuing the punchy trend. â€˜Ayesha's Drums Are
  Sex Dubâ€™ is a solid closer to wrap it all up.

>
  Rawa Club presents its first EP of 2024 from Peruvian producer LukrÃ¸. The four track EP is
  composed of two original works from the Matraca label founder. The stomping baile-funk of
  â€˜Picosaâ€™, produced alongside Venezuelaâ€™s Data High, and a tribal guaracha chaser on â€˜Choqewillkaâ€™,
  featuring Mexicoâ€™s El Chico Callado. Both tracks come accompanied by a pair of stellar remixes
  with Texan SEWA shining a light of glitched out tribal funk on â€˜Choqewilkaâ€™, whilst Moroccan
  artist Gj Leith adds a feverish pump of footwork & dancehall elements to â€˜Picosaâ€™.

>
  A rather sleazy low ender from Girl Tool on â€˜Enxameâ€™. Cranking up a groovy swing with a bass
  fuelled reggaeton arrangement, the Boorloo based act creates a pulsating club tension on this
  quick-fire no-nonsense number.

  After breaking through on Bogota imprint Trampa last October with the â€˜Augurio EPâ€™, Manchester
  based act Petfood has left us thirsty for more of their penchant club transmissions. Initiating in
  an ambient scape, before transitioning into a realm of techno and pop club, 'Mary Lou Loves You'
  embodies the Petfood mind, with sounds readily available for both the club & beyond.

  Louise KnifeFist and E The Artist smashed their world tour (of Ireland) after many PiÃ±a coladas
  were consumed and many locals were scared. JLK presents four files of unconventional rhythms and
  earth shattering kicks paired with intimate thoughts and rebellious arrangements.

  Rising Dublin producer XXXX In Stereo continues to revel in his alluring world of jungle and
  breaks. His deft touch in crafting thudding percussion arrangements in amongst angelic atmospheric
  backgrounds continues to catch our attention, and they seem to just keep getting better and
  better! Forthcoming from his â€˜M3 Sounds EPâ€™ landing on May 16th, this one is really lovely.
