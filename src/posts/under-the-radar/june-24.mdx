  titleLabel="(ANSIA)"

  When I think of forward-thinking techno, I think of releases like this. Exciting textures,
  excellent mixing, and silly genre deconstructions - Michael. ‘Imago’ uses mind-bending sounds that
  feel like they’ve fallen over the ledge into nothingness, with ‘Nil Frigo Ah’ being the clear
  crowning example of this. Disassociating patterns rattle in ‘Set Em’ and the Foodman remix of
  ‘Thoughts, Heavy’.

  title="2. Primitive Soundscapes by Bakongo"

  titleLabel="(eterna)"
  embed="album=3814692877"
>
  Eterna, the latest addition to Lisbon's dynamic music landscape, presents its second release
  ’Primitive Soundscapes’, by the visionary producer Bakongo (Livity Sound) otherwise known as Roska
  for his invaluable pioneering work in UK Funky.ZZPrimitive Soundscapes is unnerving tonally.
  Simple elements bounce out of rhythm and we can’t help but disagree with the bio that reads
  ‘sun-kissed bouncy groove adorned with uplifting melodies’. It’s spooky. It’s mesmerising. It
  feels like we shouldn’t really be listening to this without supervision.

  embed="album=3209560740"
>
  Wobblin’ into the festival season with INVT, the Miami duo’s new EP is a melting pot of cross
  border sounds from the UK and the Americas. The basses are wide and spacey, and the drum patterns
  are swung and groovy. Flying under the radar even when it was picked as one of the best releases
  of the month from Resident Advisor.

  titleLabel="(D​.​KO34)"

  Four House tracks from Paris with equal parts braindance, acid, and modulation. ‘U Want Dis’ by
  Binary Digit is up first with dance-inducing 150 bpm electronica with a vocal CTA. It’s
  melody-rich, reminiscent of his break-out track ‘Und 38490’. If you were at Caribou in Dublin on
  the 6th of July, you would have heard the latter tune. Following is ‘Morning’ by Fasme with a more
  melancholy touch giving us electro and acid basslines to make you thunk, then GGGG, with ‘La
  Cueillette’, offers some sprinkling synths that sits neatly in the float house genre. ‘Mesonyx’ by
  Mud Deep (Co-owner of D.KO Records) and Sans-Qui closes out with some euphoric electronica heading
  into fuzzy breakbeats. A great release from D.KO records with an awesome release party that
  accompanied it.

  D*mp (Ryan Dwyer) gifts us with four demos that samples his grandfather’s piano into downbeat
  moody tracks with spoken word from close friends. Weighted with emotion and creativity, D*mp’s
  productions are easy to come back to again and again. Need a hug? Listen to D*mp. Also, like, go
  hug someone.

  title="6. NUTTY by Bodysync"
  link="https://bodysync.bandcamp.com/album/nutty"
  embed="album=704207211"
>
  In their own words – “it’s dance music by fans of DIY punk and Y2K pop, with a healthy dose of
  absurdity”. Keeping things a bit nutty and glossed in 90’s rave aesthetic, Bodysync release a
  funky album meant for all ears. No gatekeeping here, this is pure optimism in under thirty
  minutes. The album operates like we’ve just tuned into a radio station with comedic audio bites
  filling the space between the huge variety of sounds. A fantastic album with standouts like ‘I
  Can't Stop’ rocking on with acid arps, ‘Babies’ grooving hard with a squelchy bass, ‘What Us
  Worry’ beaming with old-skool cha-cha slide vibes, and ‘6 million’ riding high as a peak-time
  dance floorfiller. Running the numbers, this release flies under the radar considering Ryan
  Hemsworth’s (one half of Bodysync) Instagram following!

  title="7. Warehouse Dubs Vol 1 by Warehouse Rave"
  link="https://warehouserave.bandcamp.com/album/warehouse-dubs-vol-1"
  embed="album=2792886080"
>
  91 riddimz for £20 isn’t too bad? Warehouse dubs carries a lot of big names like CRRDR, DJ Crisps,
  Main Phase, Old Boy, and our recent Sweatbox guest Zuli. Also on the cards is Ambit, who we’re
  very excited to play alongside at Macalla Festival this July. Their track carries an ominous, dark
  mood with grungy basses and crisp chopped-up breaks.

  title="8. Club Cute by BEN HAUKE"
  link="https://benhauke.bandcamp.com/album/club-cute"
  embed="album=1926376494"
>
  It’s all about the groove at Club Cute. The Londoner, along with some close pals, covers a full
  spectrum of sound with grime, tek, dub, bass, and hip-hop on show. A diverse range gelled together
  by his personal touch which embraces ‘feel’ over fidelity. CuuUuute!

  embed="album=1460168536"
>
  ‘Like a Summer’ by Darlynn is the collaboration between producer Daria Lourd and vocalist Jaelynn
  Walls. It’s a light and fun UKG number with catchy melodies that gets remixed by three producers
  with mucho talent; RITCHRD, introspekt, and Bastiengoat.

  title="10. Into Blu Sky by Dåser"
  link="https://daserdub.bandcamp.com/album/into-blu-sky-rtd002"
  embed="album=2585483364"
>
  Budding bass music from Reasons to Dance co-head Dåser on Into Blue Sky, the second release from
  the Irish label. Another exciting Irish act hailing from the capital, finds flow here with quartet
  of unconventional bass tracks, luring us in with cascading break beats, low end driven proggy
  house, glowing and groovy 140 4x4’s, and dub fuelled baile. Sputnik One joins in to lend his hand
  on maybe the EP’s standout, ‘Bubble Baile’, adding a pacing funky twitch to the original. A really
  exciting debut EP. We’ll be keeping an eye on both Reasons to Dance and Dåser going forward.

  link="https://hdmurder.bandcamp.com/album/england-as-a-succubus"
  embed="album=2251581134"
>
  Fretting soundscapes from Dorset boy Ship Sket. From jittery synth progressions that fall into
  drill, to sample torn deconstructica, Sket haunts, daunts, and excites across four tracks of
  uncompromising, psychedelic bass music.

>
  A certain Glasgow spinster has been dishing out an array of low key Soundcloud heataz over the
  past month or so. DJ Maicol’s La Mas Berraka alias churns out a Latin-tinged electro trash waltzer
  here, one of a handful of tracks that has appeared on their cloud in recent weeks. They’re all hot
  as hell, but this is perhaps the standout. This guy be taking over!

>
  Glasgow icon HUNTRESS adds a fiery club spin to Tinashe’s unavoidable superhit ‘Nasty’ with
  references to Philly club hero JAVASCRIPT. Think raunchy Baltimore club with tinges of baile-funk
  & jersey and you’re somewhere about there with this one.

  title="14. Intifada by Lúnasa"

  embed="track=1372230001"
>
  Growingly influential Dublin act Lúnasa lands with a beautifully momentous ambient breakbeat
  number on ‘Intifada’. The track illustrates current global hopelessness with desires for a
  brighter future. 100% of the proceeds from this track will go to PAL humanity. This initiative
  provides aid primarily in the form of medication distribution, nappies, menstrual pads, baby
  formula etc.

>
  Roo Honeychild’s iconic City Imp label returned this June after teasing their first works back in
  2021. A while to wait but all the more worth it with this club epic from fellow Dubliner Ozwald.
  Combining jersey club, Baltimore, summery breaks, juke trax, and even Aoife McGregor’s infamous
  voice note rant :O Back of the Bus has it all and more!

>
  Italian net label angels gun club return for the fourth instalment of PERREOTEK. 24 tracks of
  various perreo formulas, merging the infamous Latin sound with psytrance, electro, and sensual
  reggaeton & dancehall imaginings. Big hitters like Brenda, CRRDR, & Edinburgh club titan papa wkd
  all appear on the VA.

  embed="album=564352341"
>
  NTS Radio resident and psychic reader, Peach is reviving tech house with square basses, punchy
  kicks, and delicate synth lines. After becoming Boiler Room’s sweetheart in 2022, she has gone
  from strength to strength with her musical journey. ‘Charmed’ EP is four tracks full of club
  goodies. The second track, ‘Charmed’, is the standout with a fun split of sprinkly synths and
  squelchy basses on top, and rigid, compressed drums underneath.

  title="18. Dream by Hekt"
  link="https://hektttt.bandcamp.com/album/dream"
  embed="album=1268242896"
>
  Seriously electrifying club music from Danish act Hekt on the stalwart Glasgow imprint Numbers.
  Title track ‘Dream’ is a truly momentous number, one you’d expect to be lighting up festival
  circuit’s globally this year (It probably is, I’ve just not been too many ;). Such an inducing
  melody and vocal chop that is then followed by the sultry bass of ‘Front’. Two tracks that go head
  first. Maybe my release of the summer so far… Chill out Brat stans!

  junoEmbed="6651513-02"
>
  A release that may have been criminally overlooked due to a certain Charli. Blue Hawaii’s dance
  epic ‘Diamond Shovel’ is yet another typically vibrant entry from the Montreal duo. An insatiable
  pop club album firing out euro dance pumpers, hard electro, and tear jerking slow sets. Think
  Kylie. Think Soft Cell. Then think TAAHLIAH. Brutalismus 3000. Sounds like a delectable meeting of
  minds right?! That’s kind of the vibe here. A few Polacheky tones too. All in all, unreal.
