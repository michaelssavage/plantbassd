### fparty and vision dublin co-founder TOMÁS is our next feature on the playlist takeover.

A regular at @konspiracyclub and @fpartyu Tomás' hard hitting techno cuts are on the rise with recent releases on @milkitsounds and an upcoming release on @common\_\_\_\_ground.

With what last year should have had in store for this man, we hope that 2021 will be kinder. With sets at @lifefestival, @fuinneamh_festival, and support sets for FJAAK and Nancy Live under his belt, club time can't come quick enough.

1. New Members - Deep In The Night
2. J-Zbel - Tunnel Vision
3. Thomas P. Heckmann - Himmel & Hoelle
4. B2 - Hymnen an die Nacht
5. Peter Van Hoesen - Trim the Facts
6. Four Tet - LA Trance
7. Oneohtrix Point Never - Boring Angel
8. Alloy Mental - Gotta Love
9. TOMÁS - Bugrats

Until then, here are 9 tunes that you could expect to hear in a TOMÁS set: <HoverLink url="open.spotify.com/playlist/5skAgzUfGmZLwrOPNLnGVf" name="Plant Bass'd Picks." external />
