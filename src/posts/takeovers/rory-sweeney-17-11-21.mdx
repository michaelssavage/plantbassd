### Next up on our Playlist takeover is multi-genre wiz Rory Sweeney!

A seemingly constant releaser, Rory is known to dip between the realms of jungle, trap, hip-hop, Garage & more.

His latest work under the Carlos Danger alias featured on our Fresh Juice series, and he has contributed sounds to the recent @city_impd5 & @vsn_world V/A compilations. He is also a frequent collaborator with Dublin's ever energetic @julialouiseknifefist.

One third of the @bittentwicecollective, Sweeney has made a name for himself within Dublin's underground electronic sound, and the constant variation within his productions has made him into one of Ireland's most exciting producers in a very short period of time.
