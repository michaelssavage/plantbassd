### Kerry's very own Efa O'Neill offers up this week's selekts as we reach week 8 of the Spotify Takeover.

Founder of the @outofspace808 party series which also holds down a residency on @dublindigitalradio, O'Neill has become well known for her electro and rave influenced sets.

She has been able to push this sound on the Irish festival circuit with appearances at @bodyandsoulirl, @epfestival (Anachronica/ Rave in the Woods), @alltogethernow.ie, @othervoiceslive, @openearfest, and was set to feature at last year's installment of @lifefestival .

International club dates in London's @picklefactorye2 and features on bills alongside names like Prosumer, ORLA, and SPECIAL REQUEST to name but a few have followed.

Most recently we seen Aoife showcase her talent on the @avafestival x @boilerroomtv takeover of @district_8_dublin just prior to pandemic times, and she has shared mixes on @nts_radio, @rinsefrance, @fourfourmagazine, and was due to appear on @hoer.berlin with @strawberriesdublin last October only for travel restrictions.
