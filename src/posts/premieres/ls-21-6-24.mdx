Tripalium Corp's Fucked-Up Squad returns for Volume 3 this June 28th!

"Twenty-one fucked-up tunes coming from all over the world. Twenty-one sick tracks made by some of the most freaky producers of our insane era. Twenty-one nuggets for your summer parties, mixing ghetto jungle, future bass, glitchy rave, nutter breakcore, acidic braindance and melancholic drum'n'bass."

Our featured premiere comes from Ethos Records founder LS who reinvigorates Missy Elliot's classic 'Get Ur Freak On', with a glitching low end blitzer filled with shadowing breaks and electrified pads. One for the dark rooms.
