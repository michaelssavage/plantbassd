<hr />

Australian label Different Intel continue on their recent run of form with the imprints first vinyl release arriving via Henry Greenleafâ€™s â€˜Keepsakeâ€™ EP.

A reflective piece on creative exploration and personal growth, that was written while navigating post-university unemployment. The release samples records and cassettes to weave a unique tapestry of sound, each track stretching anticipations with an eclectic blend of strange sound effects, filter sweeps, and other alterations, showcasing a diverse palette of sound and meticulous attention to detail. Embodying the spirit of fearless innovation, listeners are invited on an immersive pursuit of creativity and connection.

Our featured premiere, â€˜Get The Hell Outâ€™, is a swirling bass runner brimming with enticing effects and trinkets over a forceful UK funky foundation. Everything falls together seamlessly here, but there is a palpable relentlessness to the tracksâ€™ percussive elements that you cannot ignore.

â€˜Keepsakesâ€™ arrives on wax this June 7th via Bandcamp and all other major vinyl selling platforms. Digital release to follow.
