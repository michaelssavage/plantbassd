<hr />

gullydoctor releases their new EP, essence on May 30th. The former member of Dublin's notorious Sim Simma collective pushes sounds from The Caribbean & South America. With many years of jazz training under his belt, he brings that same adventurous spirit to both his productions and DJing, blending these influences with UK Garage, Hardcore, Jungle, Footwork, Jersey Club and beyond.

Our feature premiere 'Prince Heavy Shocker' samples the retro-funk 1994 track, 'Dream On Dreamer' by The Brand New Heavies before racing into jungle territory. Constantly evolving with rich textures and speedy grooves, gullydoctor rides out the track with a sultry guitar solo.
