<hr />

Cuban duo Burnt Offerings land on Taiwanese imprint Over My Body with an exhilarating four tracker of break core, hard drum and deconstructions. Arriving as the tenth instalment on OMB, the 'Transmute' EP is a deeply honest body of work that sonically represents the human spirit's resilience to overcome times of uncertainty and hopelessness.

Our featured premiere, 'Departures', resonates with the feeling of letting go, moving on, and breathing in new life. Heartfelt melodies dribble gently over gushing break core patterns and quaking pads amidst strong string intermissions and charged synths. Quite an epic one this.

The full release arrives on June 21st here: <HoverLink url="overmybody.bandcamp.com/album/transmute" external /> ðŸŒ±
