Edinburgh party series & label DRIFT celebrates 5 years in operation with a very special 12 track compilation.

Initially formed out of a desire to step back from the intensity of peak-time club spaces, the Edinburgh-based music project DRIFT has enjoyed 5 wonderfully relaxed years, during which they've curated some truly memorable listening bar events across the UK. In order to celebrate the special milestone, they've asked 12 producers and artists previously involved with DRIFT in one way or another to contribute something in their own style for a very special compilation album entitled "5 Years of DRIFT".

Our featured premiere comes from the alter-ego of Shetland-born, Malmo-based producer Bolam, Timo Torben. An artist focusing on captivating, textured sounds as he explores experimental breaks, dreamy soundscapes and organic, downtempo percussion.

'Where Do We Go From Here' beautifully evolves from revereating ambient textures and spacey synths into wonderfully hypnotic downtempo breakbeat. Showcasing the very best of a range of genres in a single track and highlighting the producer's ability to create psychedelic electronic music of the highest calibre.

Releasing fully on the 15th March, the release showcases a range of genres from spoken word and ambient, through jazz and neo-soul to experimental club and dreamy, distant jungle.

Available to pre-order via Bandcamp.
