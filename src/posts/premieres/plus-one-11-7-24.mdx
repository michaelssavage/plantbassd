<hr />

Galway's Ar Ais Ar√≠s are back with their first feature EP after April's standout debut compilation, and it's Dublin's Plus One who returns with a full deck of his own supply on Volume 2.

After claiming perhaps the standout number on the imprint's first release with the Four Tet favourite 'Bonk', Plus One shares 5 fresh tracks of enigmatic bass facing electronica. Swivelling through peaks and valleys of club configured vocal chops and euphoric melodic breakdowns, the Dubliner strikes a perfect balance between pump and feeling across elements of two-step, baile-funk and bass.

Our featured premiere of 'Zero Chance' runs along the 100 zone across a fizzy dancehall foundation, rumbling further with its potent bassline amidst tripped out vocals and cascading percussion.

10/10. Get it in the bag.
