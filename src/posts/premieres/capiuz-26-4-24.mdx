A club-ready album, â€˜Fiori Notturniâ€™ that slashes a nocturnal forest landscape with fluorescents and violent bursts of color across 8 moving tracks, including a stellar remix effort from Ancestral Vision on â€˜0400â€™ and a collaboration with B E N N on â€˜Lunar Eclipseâ€™.

Our featured premiere is title track â€˜Fiori Notturniâ€™. A swooning drum track forging metallic percussion with ridging kicks, crafting a rigid balance between groove and pow.
