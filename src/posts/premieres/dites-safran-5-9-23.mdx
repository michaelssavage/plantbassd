Lyon label Dill Dodos Recife present their sixth offering with Dites Safran's 'Turning Boa'. 6 tracks inspired by the pulsating energy of rush hour, Safran travels through dense sonic intermissions of textured zones in trap, deconstructed club, and low end hard drum.

Our featured premiere 'Cosi' confides in the ever-changing screeches, sirens, shouting and sanity testing combustion of an evening gridlock. Intelligent breakbeats, liquid trinkets, and distant movements & murmurings create the backdrop on this heady wall of noise, taking a step away from the club and into the dreaded real world.

Turning Boa drops in full on September 14th here: <HoverLink url="https://dilldodosrecife.bandcamp.com/album/tuning-boa" external /> ðŸŒ±
