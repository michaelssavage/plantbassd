Gorgeous, angelic, bliss. Catalan sensation ETM sends us into emotional overdrive with this bygone breakbeat epic.

A hat tip to one of the more endearing generations of dance floor lore, 'I Believe' is derived from the synergies of 90's breakbeat, encapsulating the textures of Orbital, Liquid & Rhythm On The Loose with its suspenseful piano melodies & powerful vocals.
