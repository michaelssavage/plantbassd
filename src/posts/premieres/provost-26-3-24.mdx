Edinburgh's Palidrone returns with it's third release courtesy of resident Provost. Tantalising and aggressive throughout, Provost marks his debut EP out in style with 3 tracks of blistering UK tinged techno fitted with Palidrone's growing hallmarks of dense percussion, ridging kicks, alluring vocal chops and bass rumblings.

Falling as the EP's closer and title-track 'Static' is a shimmying combustion of funky laced kicks and sharp percussion that gathers a clubby tension with it's steamy vocals and melodic groove.

Static lands on Bandcamp on March 29th here: <HoverLink url="https://provostuk.bandcamp.com/album/static"  external /> ðŸŒ±
