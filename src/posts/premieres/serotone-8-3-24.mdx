Glasgow's Hang Tough returns with a tight knit 3 tracker from Scottish act Serotone.

Serotone delightfully fuses jazz influences with raw, uncompromising UK rave sounds. The Edinburgh based acts creates dense spatial sonics across across a range of speeds 'n' styles in dub, garage and breaks, maintaining an emotive and endearing feel within the tracks throughout.

Title-track 'Breaking Boundaries' is a surging breakbeat number that holds down a pacing yet subdued drum pattern. Rippling, echo effects help in creating a sense of slow-motion on this swift drum runner, alluding to the need for reflection during the relentless chaos of everyday life. Contemplative intricate breakbeat for all lugs.
