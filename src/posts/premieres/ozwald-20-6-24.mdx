Roo Honeychild's City Imp returns for the label's second instalment with Dublin stalwart Ozwald's Back Of The Bus EP.

Over three years in the making, Ozwald takes on Jersey Club, Juke and Jungle, reconfiguring them with his maverick style, whilst partnering up the likes of USHMUSH to face some old foes along the way. This is Irish Club Music in peak form, delivered by its most distinguished and BASS addled purveyors

'Aoife's Neck' is a bona fide classic of Dublin's underground. It appeared originally as a Soundcloud edit in 2018 and has circulated through local DJs collections ever since. This floor burner is built around a maniacally chopped sample of Aoife McGregor's famous 'NECK' related Whastapp voice message. City Imp doctrinal history upholds the original Aoife's Neck as ground zero for Dub[lin] Club [Music] as a genre, the earliest fully successful attempt to subsume the aesthetic spirit of Jersey Club to a uniquely Irish memetic idiom. The 2024 update stays faithful to the original while innovating in the realm of percussion. The extra sauce in this department and extension of the 4x4 rhythms delivers a DJ tool that is equal parts sludgey and frenetic, sure to freak out even the most experienced of dancers.

Back of The Bus lands in full on June 25th here: <HoverLink url="https://cityimprecords.bandcamp.com/album/back-of-the-bus-ep" external />

With a launch party to boot at Wigwam Dublin on June 28th feat. Ozwald, Ushmush and Roo!
