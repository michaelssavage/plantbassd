<hr />

Ethos Records return with their second V/A in the shape of Dancing Poetry II. Mining their signatures sounds of experimental electro, breakbeat, bass & techno, the imprint cough up a further 9 tracks of a similar description from heavyweights like Pal Parallax, Elena Sizova & Owghost to name but a few.

Our featured premiere comes from Capon, with the menacing 'Ancient Energy' which surges off a pacing breaks foundation. Ridging kicks and eastern backgrounds forge this one into a real pace setter. One of our favourites from the whole compilation we must admit.

The full release lands on June 28th here: <HoverLink url="https://ethosrecords.bandcamp.com/album/dancing-poetry-ii" external /> ðŸŒ±
