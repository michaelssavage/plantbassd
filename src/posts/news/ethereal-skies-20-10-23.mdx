The Dublin based avant-garde electroniq party, backed by Mark Davis (darkmavis), enters the label world with a collection of dreamy club efforts from some of the most gifted producers coming out of Ireland and afar.

21 tracks are contained within Aerga, representing the multifunctional, the dysfunctional and the elegant, all of which Ethereal Skies has fostered in its club line-ups to date. Think Dark0, TAAHLIAH, TDJ. Now see and hear 2manycolours, Doubt, Sweet Philly & more. Always genre-defying yet remaining true to the core of vitality the club. ES have gathered together a pool of artists that quite simply run riot with this ethos across 90+ minutes.

From Marina Potion Club & Nienna’s cozy house palettes, to the hard groove stomps of HelloKT & Dylan Fogarty, avant-trance from Gaffa, and Rory Sweeney’s neo-grime, you’re sure to find your alley way here.

A seriously promising first go at it from Mark and Ethereal Skies which drops in full on November 17th.
