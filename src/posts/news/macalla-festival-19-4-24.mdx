A new Irish festival comes our way this Summer, promising a unique blend of local Irish musicians, knowledge sharing talks, healing workshops, and an emphasis on using your cúpla focail. Conceived by Misha Freshin, whose resume spans international DJ gigs as far as Mexico City, to intimate beach raves on the east coast of Ireland. Misha and his team aim to fill the void left by beloved festivals like Body & Soul and Life Festival, capturing that endearing raucousness we all crave come festy season. Set in the mystical Keadeen Mountain Farms in Co. Wicklow, it looks to have all the right components for a memorable weekend.

The heart of Macalla is a commitment to conscious, positive music and low end frequencies that nourish the soul. Drawing on Misha's experience curating the lineup for the Sibín Beag stage at Fuinneamh festival, Macalla promises to showcase a wide range of sounds from Jazz, Soul, RnB and Hip-hop to all the flavours of Bass music right now.

The journey towards the celebration kicked off in February with a launch party in Dublin’s Wigwam, followed by another gig in Waterford’s Bank Lane. Killa P, Ophelia, Pitch 037, and newly formed Deise Dubbers gave a taste of what attendees could expect come July. Macalla’s final pit stop before the real thing in the summer is at Cuba nightclub in Galway on Friday 24th of May. Hosted by ourselves, we are joined by forward-thinking locals Kelsey and Stella, as well as Dublin icon MathMan to close things out.
