In a time when many people have struggled to find inclusivity, the collective (all of whom are female DJs and designers) have created what is for now an online solution, that will without doubt grow into an influential physical space in Dublin with plans to stage DJing workshops, talks, open deck sessions, as well as club nights of their own.\n\nIt is clear how valuable such a space will become once clubland returns to Dublin‚Äôs currently dejected scene with @yamamoritengu set to become the place of worship for the project. Although it is not a foreign subject to the city with other collectives and events helping to push forward in this area, there is still not enough being done within the city or opportunities being made available for safe and equal dance floors, which S&B aims to correct.\n\nSo far, we have seen the ‚ÄòSkin & Blister in Conversation‚Äô series bring interesting discussions around creative identity and introductions to DJing with industry heads like @akhhd and @caitfa respectively.
