### Plant Bass'd takes the SweatBox series for an exploration through the theme of DOOM..

Blending gut-wrenching bass arrangements with a mood-setting interior and lighting, we will be taking the usual pumped up hotbox to darker territories with destructive selections from Parisian producer De Grandi, inner-city blitzer KAVARI, as well as local residing drum runners MM and AKUMU on hand to embed the texture.
