Fun, mischievous percussion & wobbly basses from the likes of Burna with â€˜Peak Hourâ€™ and  Ovid with â€˜Contingencyâ€™. LÃºnasaâ€™s contribution goes hard incorporating a multitude of samples giving the track non-stop energy and freshness throughout. Perfect for the encroaching Summer festies.

album=1038781081
Artist Ira Bespalova curates filthy electro-armored jams for the two part VA. Choose at random from any of the nine tracks to fully test the limits of your speakers. â€˜Lakad Matatagâ€™ by Any Act surrounds your head with a nasty sidechained stereo bass, â€˜wig splitâ€™ by skrpump boosts the bpm with some breaks, and â€˜Electro Systemâ€™ by Trust True closes the VA with distortion at its limit. Cherry on top with â€˜Chevo Chevoâ€™ by Locked Club appearing after a tough year for their crew. True punks of the electro scene showing the very real avant-garde of rave in Russia atm.
