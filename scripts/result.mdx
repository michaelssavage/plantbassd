>
  Glasgow party turned label, Erosion enters the fray with its first release from London’s Slacker
  on ‘View from an Empty Lake’, with an added dose of Doctor Jeep, who tackles a remix of
  ‘Shuttered’. Dark, gritty, and metallic club constructions are the order here across 4 original
  workings of UK techno and bass runners.

>
  Rory Sweeney’s Carlos Danger moniker returns with the Irish Hash Mafia mixtape. Paying homage to
  90s Southern US hip-hop forms like Memphis and trap, alongside trinkles of experimental grime and
  hip-hop, Sweeney gathers together an eclectic group of Ireland’s current wave of hip-hop artists
  across 12 tracks. Think E THE ARTIST, Ahmed with Love, Smokey, & more. Then think Tommy Wright,
  Lil Ugly Mane, Princess Loko. Sounds good right?

>
  Has there been a more anticipated release in this first half of the year than SLOUCHO’s debut full
  feature? An artist of the moment, the Irish act has worked tirelessly to bring together NPC’s
  world of duality, mining sonics with an intriguing visual playground to uncover the ins and outs
  of the SLOUCHO world. 9 tracks full of heartfelt two steps, neo-grime, organ bass and ambient
  featuring dreamy team ups with a plethora of fellow Irish talent in EMBY, Curtisy, Rory Sweeney &
  more. NPC should have your attention by the end of this read if not already.

>
  Ethereal yet haunting deconstructions from the Istanbul based Rumina & Starleaf on Ecuador’s C.
  T.M. Fixating on tribal tones with layered elements of glitching dembow and hard drum, this two
  tracker finds a way to lure with harmonic backgrounds and tentative percussion of a dystopian
  nature.

>
  Dawn Razor and ArcheTech, two friends and two-thirds of the once-active trio Sonnen Blumen Kerne,
  have collaborated to deliver an album of tracks previously released exclusively on vinyl through
  Dawn Razor’s NARA Records. When Lobster Theremin ceased operations, the stock of these releases
  was lost, leaving only brief preview snippets online. A collection of 10 tracks that blur the
  boundaries between slammin' electro, breakbeat, and mutated bass, all with a minimalist edge.

>
  In a blizzard of noise-speckled, ice-cold beatdowns from the London underground, Sneaker Social
  Club welcomes back Ivy Lab to the fold. The 20/20 LDN squad build upon their renewed focus on
  brittle, incisive uptempo dancefloor gear for the gritty end of the night. From the scathing mids
  and tops of ‘OURDOGISMISSING’ via the densely packed jungle tekno abstraction of ‘Torpedo’ on to
  the high octane drum flex of ‘12345’, this is a razor sharp, ear-snagging blast of dancefloor
  modernism from a crew with their own twisted vision of what slaps on a system.

>
  Belfast’s Swoose continues on his assured rise to prominence in 2024 with this hard house
  manifesto on Saoirse’s trUst imprint. The Irish act has once again crafted a firm mould of deep,
  sincere energies with heady club grooves across these 4 tracks. ‘Cubensis’ is the stand out with
  its fizzing acidic 4x4 pump sure to arouse any club floor.

>
  Scottish post-punk outfit 22 Beaches receive the reissue treatment on Glasgow label Seated
  Records, compiling the sounds that defined the Stirling band throughout their formative years
  during ‘80-’84. Peers of bands like Cocteau Twins and The Wake, although never quite reaching
  their levels of commercial success, 22 Beaches output in terms of production and performance was
  vast during their short 4 year stint as a group. This release of mostly unheard recordings
  uncovers sounds of raw punk & funk, through to balearica and psych folk across 8 hits.

  percussion and deep ridging bass lines, the Amsterdam based act derives incredible energies from
  these minimally layered tracks, highlighting the power within the instrumentals used.

  Locked and loaded single with rumbling basses in one corner and Emz’ in-your-face vocals in the
  other. At 168 bpm, it's weighty and full of tension thanks to the violin stabs you’d get in a

  A bold collision of dubstep, breakbeats and drum and bass. ‘In My Fury’ is the sound of Jan Loup
  channelling personal challenges into empowering music that serves as a soundtrack to a therapeutic
  warrior dance. Cimer from Toulouse for the sound system testers.

  Pineapple records give us a collection of exceptional UKG-flavoured yet totally unique tracks from

  Martyn, the Dutch artist now based in Washington D.C., just dropped an absolute gem. "Through
  Lines" serves up 12 low-tempo electronic tracks that are pure magic. It's more like a historical
  document of his life between 2005-2015, all remastered and fresher than ever. Groovy stuff with
  his timeless remix of TRG’s “Broken Heart,” and the deep, rare cut “Friedrichstrasse.”

  Mutual Pleasure records lead hottie Partiboi69 appears on Raredub’s seductive Rare, Raw, and Ready
  EP with his usual lyrical flow. It sits nicely placed in the middle of some heavy no-filler techno
  bangers. Think FJAAK, X Club, KETTAMA.
